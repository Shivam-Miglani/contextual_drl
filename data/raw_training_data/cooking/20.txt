Easy steps on making pretzels
In a big bowl mix the salt brown sugar and yeast with a cup of lukewarm water
Whip the mixture while gradually adding the flour until the dough is smooth and free from bumps
If you think the dough is a little too sticky add more flour
(Tip: It is better to let the dough sit overnight inside a plastic container placed in the fridge
Doing so would make the bread a more fluffier and softer
The dough will rise overnight so you better use a large container Cut the dough into 4 to 12 pieces depending on the size you intend for the dough
Roll each piece to make a rope
Just make sure that the strips are very thin
If possible make its diameter less than a standard pencil
Bigger pretzels can be made from ropes with thickness of about that of a cigar
Shape the dough rope into an upside down J
Get the ends together and twist them leaving a circle at the two tails
Bring the tails on the circle
Flatten the ends using your fingers and blend them in the dough
When you are satisfied with the shape of your pretzel you can now place the dough on top of a greased cookie sheet
Allow the pretzels to rise for about thirty minutes
Brush the pretzels with a mixture of water and baking soda
To achieve a chewy crust mix two tablespoons of baking soda with 4 cups of boiling temperature water
Dip the dough in the mixture for about 10 seconds
Mix the egg and water and use this to brush the surface of the pretzels in order to give them a shiny glaze
Place your choice of toppings sea salt parmesan cheese sesame seeds or cinnamon and sugar
Bake in the oven that is pre-heated with 400 to 450 degrees for 10-15 minutes
