Give your basic caesar salad a tasty twist by adding slices of chicken it
And to add even more flavor opt for grilled chicken rather than fried
Then choose the freshest lettuce you can get to make each bite more succulent
Hungry for salad yet
Let's start making it
Fry the bacon bits in the pan over medium-high heat until the bacon bits are crispy and golden brown in color
Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towel to drain the excess oil
Set aside
Add the pieces of bread to the frying pan then cook until golden brown to make croutons
Remove the croutons from the heat and transfer to the plate with the bacon bits
Prepare the dressing by putting all the ingredients in the food processor and blending until the mixture gets a smooth consistency
Transfer the salad dressing into a glass jar or bowl with a lid and refrigerate
Wash the lettuce leaves carefully and carefully blot out the excess water with a paper towel
Tear the leaves into small bite-sized pieces and put the leaves in the serving bowl
Drizzle the leaves with the dressing and toss lightly
Add salt and pepper to taste
Place the chicken pieces bacon bits croutons and egg on top of the bed of lettuce
Serve
If you want a healthier dressing you can replace the mayonnaise with olive oil
You can also use bacon alternatives from health food stores
