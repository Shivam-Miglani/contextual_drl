Go ahead and keep those favorite shirts that have seen better days in the fit department
And don't worry about buying that perfect shirt that's a bit too small because with this simple alteration technique you can make any shirt fit like a glove
Remove the buttons on the sleeves with a seam ripper
Then resew them closer to the edge which will give your arms much more room to move
Cut up the center back of the shirt and stop when you get to the yoke
Press the raw edges under a half an inch
Find some pretty lace or coordinating fabric to insert into the back
With the right sides of both fabrics facing up pin the coordinating fabric under the opening you made in the back
Sew down both sides of the opening close to each edge
Trim the extra fabric from the inside of the shirt and leave a half-inch seam allowance
Now you not only have a shirt that fits and isnâ€™t busting at the seams but one that's pretty in the back too
