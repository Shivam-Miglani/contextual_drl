How to make homemade pizza
Preheat the oven to 425F
Pour the yeast in hot water to dissolve it
Stir in sugar and salt into the water using a fork
When the salt and sugar has combined well with the yeast mixture start adding in the flour
Add half a cup at a time slowly stirring to dissolve the flour
To finish the dough add in the oil stirring vigorously
After mixing the oil into the dough check the consistency of the dough
You can add another half cup of flour if the dough is too sticky
Let the dough rise for about 30 minutes in a bowl covered by a kitchen towel
Take the risen dough out of the bowl and start kneading it on a floured surface
Coat your hands with flour as well so that the dough won't stick to your fingers
Spread the dough on the greased cookie sheet
Note: It's best to use a baking spray to grease the sheet evenly
Pour the tomato sauce over the dough
Use a spatula to spread the sauce towards the edges
Add the toppings then sprinkle the cheese on top of everything
Note: To add more color and flavorful aroma finish up by sprinkling herbs such as rough-chopped oregano or basil over your pizza
Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes
When your pizza is done take it out and serve it immediately
