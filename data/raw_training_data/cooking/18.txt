How to make potatoes au gratin
Layer the potato slices into the baking dish
You can layer the potatoes any which way you like but I prefer to place them in rows one on top of the other
In the saucepan melt the butter over medium-low heat
Transfer 3 tablespoons of the melted butter to the cup or small bowl
Set aside
Add the flour into the butter remaining in the sauce pan
Stir to mix well
Gradually add the milk into the mixture in the saucepan
Let the mixture simmer on low heat until the mixture gets a smooth and thick consistency
Add the cheese into the mixture
Stir until the cheese is completely melted
Pour the mixture over the potatoes inside the baking dish
Be careful not to ruin the arrangement of the potatoes
Give the sauce time to seep to the bottom of the dish
Place bread crumbs in the bowl with the melted butter and toss to coat evenly
Spread the crumbs evenly over the potatoes
Bake at 400 degree F for about 15 minutes
