You can do so by adding homemade broccoli soup to your meals
Its very simple and easy to make
Here is a simple step-by-step guide on how to make broccoli soup
Add two tablespoons of olive oil to a soup pot at medium heat
You do not want the olive oil to overheat because then it simply dissipates which would certainly not be helpful since the olive oil is intended to saute the vegetables
Saute onions and chopped celery in a pot until onions have become soft and transluscent
Add the peeled potatoes and broccoli to the pot
And saute for another 5 to 6 minutes
Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and simmer for 3 minutes
Pour in the nonfat milk
The milk is important because it contributes to the creamy thickness of the soup
Without it the soup would end up being very watery
It is also important to pour the soup and the milk to the pot very quickly after the potato and the broccoli have been added
You do not want to try and saute them as this is not necessary
Also there will not be enough olive oil in the pot to do so which creates the risk the potato and the broccoli will end up getting burned if allowed to sit in the pot for too long
Allow the soup in the pot to come to a boil and then reduce the heat from medium to very low
Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer for 20 minutes or so
Once the vegetables have become tender you will know you are done with the cooking part
Let the soup cool a little and then pour it into a blender
This is a step many people skip when making broccoli soup but it is an important one
Mixing the soup up in the blender until all the contents are properly smoothed ensures you do not end up with lumpy soup
After the soup has been blended you can reheat it in the pot
Serve hot and enjoy with family and friends
