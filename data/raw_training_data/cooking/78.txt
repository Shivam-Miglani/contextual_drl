Make the batter
In a bowl mix flour salt and pepper
Then beat the egg yolk and add water
Gradually pour the egg mixture onto the dry ingredients
Mix the ingredients well until you have a thick and smooth batter
Prepare the seasoned flour
Simply mix flour salt and pepper together in another bowl
Heat the oil
Remember that you can either pan-fry or deep-fry the chicken
If you choose to pan-fry make sure the oil is one inch deep
Heat it to 350 F 175 C
If you want deep-fried chicken pour as much oil as is needed to completely cover the chicken parts
Make sure the oil reaches 325 F 185 C before putting the chicken in the pot
One by one roll the chicken pieces in seasoned flour
Then dip them into the batter then in the seasoned flour again for one last time
Make sure all their parts are covered
Let the chicken rest for a while to allow the coating to stick to the skin
After a while drop the chicken pieces into the skillet or pot using tongs
Do this very carefully as you don t want the hot oil to splash on you
Make sure not to overcrowd the skillet or pan since overcrowding decreases the temperature and causes greasy fried chicken
To avoid overcrowding fry the chicken pieces in batches
Take the chicken pieces out from the skillet or pot when they turn golden brown
Place them in a cooling rack and allow them to drain
Fry the remaining pieces the same way
Add more clean oil if needed
Now take a bite and test the crunch and try not to finish them up before everyone else gets to the table
