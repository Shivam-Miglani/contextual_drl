Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults
Frosty the Snowman
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece
Other Christmas Symbols
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family
