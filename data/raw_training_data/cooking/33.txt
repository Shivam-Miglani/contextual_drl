How to cook chinese-style rice soup with chicken and ginger
Add six cups of water four cups of chicken broth and a half a cup of Arborio rice along with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter into a slow cooker
Cover and cook over high heat until the rice is soft and soupy
Usually you will want to let it slowly cook for a full six hours
You definitely do not want to remove the contents from the slow cooker if the rice is still hard
You want the rice to be soft as this would be most appropriate for soup
When the soup in the slow cooker is about done you should take this as the cue to add up to three tablespoons of ginger and scallions
Stir them in and simmer for 2 minutes
Pour the contents of the soup into your serving bowls
Any extra soup can be put in a container and stored in the refrigerator
Top with shredded chicken and cilantro
Add chili paste on the site if desired
Serve while hot
