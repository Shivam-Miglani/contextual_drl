How to make english country scones
Preheat oven to 425F
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough
This should yield around 12 pieces
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking
Brush each dough slice with milk
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack
