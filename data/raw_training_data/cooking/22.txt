How to make sangria
Take 4 to 6 oranges slice each in half and squeeze them to make fresh orange juice
You can use your juicer for this
Strain the mixture to remove the pulp and seeds
If you are using orange juice from a bottle you can skip this part but I would recommend fresh orange juice if you want the best taste for your drink
Chill all your fruits rum wine and orange juice for a few hours
Take your whole orange lime and lemon out of the refrigerator and slice them thinly into rounds
Place the slices in a pitcher
Pour in the chilled rum and sugar into the pitcher
Keep the mixture in the refrigerator for at least two hours until you are just about ready to serve it
Before you serve the sangria crush the fruits in the pitcher lightly with a wooden spoon then stir in the chilled orange juice and wine
Adjust the sweetness of the mixture by adding more sugar if necessary
And that's that
Pour the sangria into individual glasses
If you wish you could garnish the goblets with slices of fruit or sprigs of mint leaves
