Lobsters must be cooked with a lot of care and by pairing it with a delectable sauce
In a sauce pan melt the butter in low heat
In a separate pan combine the shallots peppercorns wine vinegar and tarragon
Leave it in medium heat and reduce down to 25% of the volume
Then strain the sauce onto a heated double boiler
Whisk in the egg yolks into the reduction dropping the eggs one by one
Place the pan of yolks onto a bowl of ice cold water
Add the melted butter in a slow drizzle while whisking
Preheat the oven to 200
Drop the fries in hot oil and let it cook for 3-4 minutes in low fire
Fish out the chips from the oil and lay them on a baking pan
Sprinkle sea salt and cook it in the oven for 10-15 minutes
Place it back to the deep fryer and let it turn golden brown
In a shallow pan melt the butter in some oil
Season the meaty side of the lobster with salt and pepper and place it in the pan open side down
Cook it for a quick minute and then add the lime juice
Serve the lobster with the Barnaise sauce and chips on the side
