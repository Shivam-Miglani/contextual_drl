Eating healthy becomes easier in the summertime when fresh produce is readily available and at it's peak of ripeness
Corn on the cob happens to be one of my favorite seasonal veggies to prepare
Not only is it delicious but it's one of the easiest side dishes to whip up
Baking it in the oven is a sure way to guarantee that your corn on the cob will stay perfectly moist without fail every single time
With a recipe this easy you'll be making corn every night of the week
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
Place corn with the husks on directly on the oven racks and bake for 15 minutes
Remove the corn from the oven and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes
Remove the husks -- the silks will come right off with the husks easily
Butter the corn and sprinkle with salt and pepper
Serve immediately
This method is easy healthy and will have you happily enjoying corn on the cob all season long
