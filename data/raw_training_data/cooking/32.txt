Slowly add the eggs into the cream cheese mixture and mix well
Add in the sour cream vanilla extract and flour
Stir until the mixture is smooth
Pour the mixture into the springform pan
Do this slowly to avoid overflowing
Smooth and level out the top part of the cake
Place everything in the oven bake for 1 hour then turn the oven off but leave the cheesecake in it for 5 to 6 hours more
Take the cheesecake out of the oven and chill in the refrigerator
Serve chilled
Now this cheesecake is delectable as it is but if you like you can also top it with fresh fruits or glazed fruits such as strawberries cherries blueberries peach apple or a combination of any of these
Be sure to place the fruit glazing once the cheesecake cools just before you put the cheesecake in the refrigerator
Or drizzle your cake with chocolate syrup or caramel just before serving
Or sprinkle it with crushed cinnamon or cocoa powder
