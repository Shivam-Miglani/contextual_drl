How to make lasagne
Heat the saucepan
Add in the meat and cook it in its own fat until it is well browned
Drain most of the fat but not all we'd recommend you leave around 3 tablespoons of fat as this makes the dish tastier
Add in the onions garlic red pepper salt and pepper
Stir the meat mixture for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent
Add a few pinches of oregano and one or two tablespoons of tomato paste depending on your own taste
If you want to play it safe it's best to add just one tablespoon
Remember that too much tomato paste can make the mixture very sour
Stir in the canned tomatoes and allow the mixture to boil gently
Cover your pot and let everything simmer on low heat for 45 minutes
Meanwhile place plenty of water in another pot
Cook the lasagne noodles according to package directions
The lasagne noodles must be soft or al dente but not soggy
When the noodles are done drain them well and separate the noodles from each other
Otherwise they will tend to stick together and get torn
Set the noodles aside
When sauce mixture is done add the basil
Mix well and turn off the heat
Preheat the oven to 400 degree F
Place all the ingredients nearby for easier assembly
Ladle just enough sauce to cover the bottom of the baking pan
Place four pieces of lasagne noodles on top of the sauce
If the noodles get torn piece them together as much as possible
Spread a thin layer each of ricotta mozzarella and parmesan cheeses on the noodles
Ladle on more sauce and continue with the rest of the layers in the same order: sauce noodles and cheeses
You should have at least 3 layers of these items
After the third layer spread a layer of ricotta cheese on top of your creation then pour on the rest of the sauce
Finally top everything with all your remaining cheese
Put your tray into the oven and bake for 40 minutes
