Still if you want to make your own homemade sausages it certainly is possible if you have the right tools for the task
Place the meat and fat in the freezer for a couple of hours or until both ingredients are cold enough for your hands to feel numb when handling them
Slice the meat and fat into small chunks about 1 inch in size
Fat should be cut a bit smaller than the meat
To keep the ingredients cold place the fat and meat chunks into a metal bowl that sits on top of a large bowl of ice
Pour in the sugar salt nutmeg parsley and garlic into the meat and fat
Mix everything well together and then put the mixture into the freezer
Mix the sherry vinegar with the dry sherry and place it in the freezer
Immerse the casings in warm water to prepare them for when you are ready to stuff the sausage
Coarsely grind the sausage mixture
Work it quickly and make sure the meat falls into a cold metal bowl
Once all the meat has been ground put it back into the freezer while you clear the area and clean up a bit
Once you're done clearing up take the mixture out of the freezer again and add the fennel seeds black pepper and the sherry vinegar and dry sherry mixture
Mix the sausage well using your hands or a wooden spoon or a stand mixer until the mixture is sticky enough to bind itself
Glide a casing into the sausage stuffer leaving about 6 inches off the tail of the tube
Put the meat into the sausage stuffer
Use one hand to regulate the speed by which the casing casts off the tube
When your casing is fully stuffed close off the open end the start point by knotting it or tying it closed with butcher's twine
To make links pinch off the length of sausage you want the spin the link away from you a few times
To make another link pinch the next portion and this time spin away from yourself
Repeat this several times until you reach the end of the coil
When you're done close off the other end of your casing then hang your sausages on the rack
Get a needle pass it through gas flame to sterilize it then start looking for air bubbles in your sausages
When you find these bubbles prick them
Let your sausages dry for a couple of hours
Then they are ready to cook by steaming boiling or frying whichever you prefer
If you don t plan to eat them yet keep them in the freezer
