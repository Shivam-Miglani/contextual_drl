When making a pina colada there are only a few ingredients you are going to need
As with the ingredient list the steps you will follow are just as short
To make your drink you will
Add 4 cups of ice in to the blender then add 3 4 cup of the pineapple juice into the mix add the rum at least 1 2 ounce if you want a more potent drink you can add more but remember to add more ice if you want a thicker drink as the rum thins out the mix lastly include about 1 2 cup of the cream of coconut in to the blend
From there you will simply blend the concoction to the desired consistency
If you want it sweeter you can increase the pineapple juice or cream of coconut for a stronger drink add more rum and for a thicker drink or more watered down version add or subtract the amount of ice you add to the mix
