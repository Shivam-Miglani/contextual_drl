If you have ever wondered about how to make coleslaw then you will be pleased to know that it is actually quite a simple process with only a few ingredients required and a little bit of spare time consisting primarily of cabbage and may also include shredded carrots as well as other fruits and vegetables
Check out these simple steps in preparing coleslaw
Use this guide and either increase or decrease the amounts accordingly
In a large bowl mix together the shredded cabbage and carrots
How fine you shred it does depend upon whether or not you want chunky coleslaw or the finer stuff but to play it safe with guests go more towards finer as it tends to be more popular
Add in your chopped onions
And just like the cabbage and carrots make them quite fine unless you are going for the chunky version
For the dressing mix together in a separate bowl one cup of mayonnaise one teaspoon of mustard salt and half a teaspoon of pepper a quarter of a cup of granulated sugar mix well in order to create the creamy dressing for the coleslaw
Pour in the dressing to the cabbage mixture and mix it through until everything is covered
Transfer mixture into a different bowl and cover with clingfilm and let it sit in the fridge for an hour or two
Serve chilled
If you want the dressing to be more creamy then all you need to do is add a tablespoon of mayonnaise or alternatively if you feel it is too thick then a tablespoon of milk will help to make it thinner
If you want to make it healthier you can use artificial sweeter as a substitute for granulated sugar
