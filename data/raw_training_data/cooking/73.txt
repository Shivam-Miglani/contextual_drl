If you want to do something new in the kitchen try making pork tostadas
Pork tostadas are definitely among the most popular
While you might think they are difficult to make when you first look at them the truth is the recipe is pretty easy to follow
Here is a simple recipe how to make pork tostadas in just a couple of hours
Place the 3lb pork loin roast on a pan and add one teaspoon of salt oregano pepper and cayenne to it and gently rub the seasonings into the loin
The pork loin should then be placed in a roasting pan fat side up
Do not cover the pan
Once in the oven bake the loin at 325 degrees
Usually it will need to bake for about two hours
Place a saute pan on the stove and add in three chopped onions
Mix in two tablespoons of canola oil let the onions saute until they are soft
Place three cloves of garlic to the mix and let it cook for another three minutes
Mix in all the main seasoning ingredients that truly do contribute to the taste of the pork tostadas
These ingredients include one chopped green pepper a half a cup of corn a half a cup of drained black beans a full cup of salsa a single teaspoon of paprika a mere half teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a minute amount about a quarter of a teaspoon of hot pepper sauce
Beware of overdoing it because it can really overtake the taste of the tostadas
Allow all the ingredients to come to a boil
When it does lower the heat cover the pan and let it simmer for a maximum of 20 minutes
Stir the mix a bit and add in a little cilantro to it
Remove the cooked pork from the oven
Let it cool a little
While it is still warm you can shred it with forks
Fry the tortillas in the remaining canola oil
You will fry each tortilla one-by-one until both sides are golden brown
You will probably have to flip them to do this
Upon removing them from the pain use paper towels to soak up the excess oil the tortillas may have absorbed
Place tortillas on serving plates
Top with shredded pork onion mixture and a little bit of cheese
