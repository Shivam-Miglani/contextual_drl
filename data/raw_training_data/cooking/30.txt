How to make peanut butter cookies
In a big bowl thoroughly cream the peanut butter and butter together using a spatula
Mix in the brown sugar and white sugar and keep creaming
Add the vanilla extract and eggs
Beat well but don't overdo it
Once you're done set this bowl aside
In another bowl sift together the baking soda baking powder flour and salt
Now add this dry mixture into the wet mixture you set aside earlier and mix well until you have a smooth batter
Optional: Drop some semisweet chocolate chips into the batter for a batch of chocolate-y peanut butter cookies
If you want a healthier variant skip the chocolate chips and add mashed bananas instead
Add crushed nuts for more texture
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
Refrigerate the batter for around 3 hours or more
Preheat the oven to 375F
Divide the dough into little balls
These will be your cookies
Put the ungreased cookie sheet on the baking pan
Arrange the balls on the cookie sheets leaving around 3 inches of space between each of them
Using a fork flatten each ball and create crisscross patterns on it
Bake the cookies for around 10 minutes
The cookies should have a nice golden brown color when they're done
Now take the cookies out of the oven and wait for them to cool before taking a big bite
