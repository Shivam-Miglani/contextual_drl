Mix borate and water
Find a borate chemical wherever pest control products are sold
Look for Timbor Boracare or a similar product
Follow the directions on their label for use
Typically these products are a powder that you must combine with an equal amount of water in a handheld sprayer
Borate works best in wood that won’t be exposed to water
It is a chemical that is not a threat to your health unlike gas fumigants
Spray the mixture over the wood
Use the handheld sprayer or brush to apply the chemical
Cover any sides of the wood you can reach
This is difficult in homes where most of the wood will be covered so it’s best to apply borate when the house is framed
If your wood furniture has varnish you’ll need to strip the varnish so the borate can soak into the wood
Scrape off the varnish or apply a chemical stripper
Any stains left by the borate should be wiped up with warm water before the finish is reapplied
Protect the wood from water
Water washes the borate off the wood
To ensure it soaks in cover the wood with a tarp
Move furniture to a safe storage area
Make sure there’s no dampness or leaks in the area
Seal the wood with a penetrating water repellant
Get a product such as Thompson’s or Rainguard
Spray or brush it onto the wood
Read the directions on the label to find out how often the repellant needs to be reapplied
The repellent will keep the borate inside the wood even when exposed to water
Heat or freeze wood
If borate isn’t enough or you don’t want to strip the finish on the wood extreme temperatures can help
You will have to treat the wood in a kiln heating chamber or freezer
The object would have to be heated for one and a half hours at 150℉ (66℃) or frozen at -4℉ (-20℃) for a week
Search your area for commercial treatment areas if you don’t have the space or tools to do it yourself
The wood must sealed in a bag before freezing to protect it from moisture
Extreme temperatures can warp and otherwise damage wood
