Place a framed picture within eyeshot
Put a framed photograph in your line of sight
Choose whatever subject makes you happy
This could be anything from a family photo to an abstract print with a pleasing color scheme
Add a candle to the mix
Candles can provide less intense light if you want to relax or have a romantic evening
Scented candles can add a pleasant aroma to the area around the nightstand and bed
On the other hand you can also use candles simply for their color line and shape to complement the overall composition of the nightstand
Use hardcover books as decorative elements
These could be books that you're currently reading
However you could also use old exhibition catalogues or coffee table books
Stack two or three with the largest book at the bottom and the smallest one on top
Use them as bases for lamps and other accessories as focal points or as balancing elements
You could get really creative and use books as the base of the nightstand
Secure the stack and place a sheet of glass or wooden board on top as the table surface
Place a sculpture in the arrangement
Choose a small- to medium-sized sculpture to avoid taking up too much space
Keep its style in line with or complementary to the rest of the décor in the room
For example if your bedroom is dominated by antiques and subdued colors a bright or abstract sculpture might clash
On the other hand an organic-shaped sculpture might provide a nice contrast to a rectangular nightstand or alarm clock
Set a tray for your jewelry or reading glasses within reach
A tray adds an artistic accent and prevents clutter caused by your watch and other accessories you need to wear during your waking hours
Choose a round or oval tray to compliment the straight geometric lines of nearby books
Opt for something more rectangular to balance an organic-shaped lamp base or oval mirror
Add a bouquet of flowers or basket of shells
These organic objects will help to offset the geometric shapes and straight lines of books and rectangular picture frames
They will also bring the outdoors into the home adding a natural accent to the décor
Choose colors that will either complement or fall in line with the bedding and other nightstand accessories
