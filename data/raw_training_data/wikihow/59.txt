Protect yourself
Cover your mouth and nose with an N-95 respirator to avoid breathing in spores
Wear elbow-length rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands from mold and cleaning materials
Cover your eyes with goggles to protect them from airborne spores
Clean hard surfaces
Mix equal parts water and detergent or bleach
Dip a scrub brush into the mixture and remove the mold
Dry the area completely when you’re finished
Fix all leaks
If you noticed any leaking pipes or water seepage in your inspection deal with it immediately
Call a professional plumber to repair leaking or sweating pipes
Fill in any spaces between pipes and walls with caulk or Icynene insulation
Seal small openings
Use caulk to seal cracks around your windows doors and at critical junctures where the walls meet the floor and the ceiling
Apply caulk or weather stripping to your windows especially between the frames and panes
Dry the area completely
Don’t caulk or paint any surfaces until the mold is completely removed
If you’re not comfortable doing these repairs hire a professional
Have your air ducts cleaned
Unless you’re trained to remove mold from air ducts call a professional
This is especially crucial if you notice mold growth in more than one room or if your mold problem keeps recurring despite your best efforts
Search online for local professionals or ask your local health department for a recommendation
Dispose of surfaces that absorb moisture
If you notice mold on carpeting ceiling tiles and other porous surfaces remove and discard them
The mold makes them unfit for recycling
Ask your local waste management whether they consider it hazardous waste
Seek assistance
If you find mold growing on books heirlooms or sentimental objects consult a professional for help
Ask a senior librarian or museum conservator to refer you to a trusted expert
You could also do online searches for professionals who repair and preserve rare objects
Make sure you get the expert’s references
If possible hire someone who is accredited by a professional organization like the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) or the American Library Association (ALA)
