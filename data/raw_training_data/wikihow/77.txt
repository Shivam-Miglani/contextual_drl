Watch out for damaged areas
Roads and other paths will have been eroded
Stay off of bridges
The soil under usual routes will be muddy and less able to support the weight of vehicles
Find alternate routes over high ground or wait for the authorities to indicate which roads are safe
Buildings that were hit by floodwaters are also dangerous
They may have unseen damage and collapse on you
Stay away from them
Avoid downed electrical lines and flooded areas
Assume any downed power lines or electrical wires are live
Don’t approach them
Assume any floodwater you see is also dangerous
Stillwater may be contaminated with gas oil and sewage
They may also have become electrified
Don’t try to enter buildings surrounded by floodwater
Turn off all electrical and gas lines
Your home may have suffered structural damage including wet electrical wires and gas leaks
Don’t depend on standard power sources
Instead inspect your home for damage using a flashlight
When possible have a professional repair the damage
If you smell gas or hear hissing get away from your home immediately
Don’t use candles or lanterns until you’re certain the gas lines are secure
Use a stick to check for snakes
Dangerous animals may have washed into your home or taken shelter there
Overturn hidden areas with a stick or pole as you search for damage
The last thing you need is to have a pet or family member bitten by a snake
Have an animal control specialist come help remove them
Take pictures of your home for insurance purposes
This may be the last thing you think of but it’s important to document the damage
Get movies or pictures of your entire house
Use a disposable camera if you have to so you can get accurate pictures of the damage
Continue capturing the necessary documentation as you clean
Contact your insurance agent for more information
Doing this will make insurance claims disaster assistance applications and income tax deductions much easier to complete down the road
Make repairs to your home
Your house may be unsafe to occupy
A sump pump wet-dry shop vacuum or water pump will remove standing water
Have a professional check your home for structural damage
Get someone to repair leaks in the septic system and gas supply before going back into your home
Follow up with electrical repair work for damaged wiring
Clean your home
Mud and water that washed into your home can contain sewage and dangerous chemicals
In addition leftover water leads to mold
Open up all the door and windows
Scrub affected areas with hot water and a cleaner like a heavy-duty laundry or dish detergent
Follow up by disinfecting with a 10% bleach and water solution
Wash your hands after cleaning
Fans are useful for blowing air out of your home or drying out hidden areas like corners
