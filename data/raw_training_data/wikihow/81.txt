Get out your barrow or cart and three buckets
Place the buckets into the barrow or cart in readiness for the next steps
Leave bucket one empty
Line bucket two with a plastic bag
In bucket three place your gardening gloves twine garden tools in readiness for gardening
Also place your cell phone in a sealed plastic bag into this bucket
This last trick stops you from feeling worried about the phone ringing (you can also take the cordless phone from the house if preferred)
Plan what needs gardening
Decide by looking at the areas of the garden that are most visually concerning (what the neighbors are looking at) and what will become a jungle if you don't tackle it now
Select these areas and give them time limits - say half an hour here one hour there an hour or so over the other side
Map these out in your mind or on paper including breaks for snacks lunch etc
Get your MP3 or radio ready
Have your favorite songs or podcasts ready to go
You can skip this step if you prefer the sounds of nature
It is however a good chance to catch up on study if you're learning a language or studying something!
Start gardening
Bucket one is for compostable items only - namely seed-free weeds dead-headed flowers etc
Bucket two is for throwing away or mulch-machine items such as diseased plants twigs branches seedy weeds etc
Wheel the barrow or cart from garden bed to garden bed as required taking care to empty out the buckets once full (it helps to have space available in the compost bin and to have a garbage can already lined etc
for taking the waste)
Take regular breaks
It's important to stop and refresh for 5 to 10 minutes here and there to have a snack or a drink
If you don't do this you'll wear out quickly and feel less inclined to keep power gardening
Finish up when your planned time is up
You can return next weekend or whenever you have some more spare time
It's important to stick to your designated time limit as this builds a healthy habit for future power gardening sessions and leaves your enthusiasm intact
