Hang antique plates as wall décor
First purchase plate hanging hardware from your local craft store
Then plan how you want to hang the plates
You could arrange them by alternating sizes shapes or colors
Choose from a circular or rectangular arrangement
Create a “distressed” paint job for wooden antiques
Remove the original paint if you don't like the color or if you think it might contain lead
For a vintage look use your index finger to apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly anywhere you don't want the paint to stick
Then paint the entire surface and let the paint dry for a few hours
After that run a damp rag over the areas you applied the petroleum jelly
The paint will come right off
Upcycle a vintage window
Hang a salvaged window of any shape or size from the wall to display as art
Place it on a wall that receives direct sunlight for an interesting play of light
To create a sense of variety complement curved lines with straight ones
For example hang a circular window above a chair with a rectangular back
You can also use each quadrant of a divided window as a picture frame
Hang vintage lithographs such as floral prints
Tack them to the wall with mounting putty or place them in small frames and hang them as you normally would
You can find mounting putty online or in your local craft store
Hang empty frames as art
If you bought an interesting antique frame but haven't found a painting or print to fill it try displaying the frame by itself
You can choose to paint it a new color or keep the original paint jobfinish
Consider making it the centerpiece of an arrangement among paintings or prints
Use old shutters as an interior backdrop
With a little imagination the possibilities with old shutters are endless
Prop three or four behind the couch or chairs to create a sense of texture on an otherwise smooth wall
Fasten them to the walls if you choose not to place furniture in front of them
On the other hand you can hang one or two shutters horizontally over the kitchen table to organize mail or display postcards
Decorate your kitchen with old cookware
If your kitchen is largely white hang vintage copper pots and pans to create a rustic feel
