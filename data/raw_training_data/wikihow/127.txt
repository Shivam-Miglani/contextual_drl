Prepare for aftershocks
Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock of an earthquake and they can cause significant damage
Expect aftershocks to occur and prepare to move to a safe location like an open outdoor space or a structurally sound building
If an aftershock does occur drop to the ground cover yourself and hold on to something until the shaking stops
Put on sturdy shoes and clothes
Try to find a long-sleeve shirt and pants so your body is protected from glass and debris
If you have access to a hard hat goggles or a mask put those on too
If you don't have access to shoes or clothes walk around debris and fallen objects to avoid hurting yourself
Exit the building once the shaking has stopped and you know it’s safe
The structure of the building you’re in may have been weakened by the initial earthquake so you should exit in case of any aftershocks that could cause more damage to the building
If you’re in a high-rise building after an earthquake hits do not use the elevators to exit
Slowly descend the stairs of the building and exit outside
If you’re in a stadium or theater exit the building calmly watching out for any debris that could fall on you
Stay put if you’re outdoors following an earthquake
Do not enter any buildings unless they have been deemed safe by authorities
Buildings that look safe could be at risk of collapse if an aftershock occurs or falling debris inside could seriously injure you
Get to a wide open space once you're outside
Avoid standing near buildings or other large objects that could fall on you if an aftershock hits
If you’re near a coast head for high ground in case a tsunami forms after the earthquake
Call your family neighbors or a roommate if you have a cell phone
Find out if they’re alright and what the status of your home is if you're not there
Make a plan and establish a place to meet
Find a local shelter if your home is unsafe to return to
If you’re not sure where the nearest shelter is ask an emergency official nearby or see if a neighbor knows
Do not re-enter your home until you are certain that it is safe
Drive carefully
Traffic lights may not be working and there could be fallen debris on the road
Clear the way for any emergency response vehicles you encounter
Use a battery-powered radio or television to listen to local emergency information
Follow the instructions of local officials and check in regularly for updates
You can also check social media or cell phone alerts for further information from authorities
