Keep a produce diary
For two weeks keep a running list of every piece of produce that your family consumes
You can write down the names of the produce and the amount eaten per day
Then go back through the list to see how much of each item youâ€™ll need to plant if you plan to eat from the garden over time
This will also allow your kids to choose their favorite foods for inclusion
Select your plants or seeds
You can either buy partially or full-grown plants from your local nursery
Or you can buy seeds from a store or online dealer
Your children may enjoy the process of physically choosing larger plants but it is also fun to watch plants grow directly from seeds
It is often a good idea to go with a mix of both mature plants and seeds
If you will have children in the garden then you may want to choose plants that are capable of surviving the curious little hands of kids
You will also want plants without thorns and ones that are not poisonous
Some great options are lavender or thornless roses
Buy quality items
If you find discount seeds online you may want to hesitate before you buy them
These seeds may be discounted for a reason and it would be disappointing to plant them with no success
Instead try to buy your garden materials from an established online seller or nursery or gardening center
They may even offer a replacement policy if the plant dies
Consider adding play equipment
A garden can also be a great area for general play
Look into placing a slide or swing on the grounds
Perhaps consider building a fort in the branches of one of the larger trees
See if there is a place for a small swimming pool or splash pad area
This will guarantee that your family spends more time out of doors and in the garden space
Add wildlife features
Try to incorporate a fish pond or perhaps a bird bath
A birdfeeder is another low-key option
You can even place an owl house or birdhouses up in the trees
All of these modifications will brings birds and other animals into the area making for great entertainment for kids or birdwatching for adults
You can make a pond or water space kid-safe by adding a fence around it or by installing a metal grille or mesh system on top of it
Consult with a pond safety specialist for more guidance
