Wash your face and hands with lemon or lime
While in the shower rub a piece of lemon or lime over the skin that most likely has deposits of vapors from cooking such as hands face and arms
The acidity in lime will help to break down the essential oils that cause the lingering curry smell
Finish by washing with soap and water as usual
Be sure to avoid open cuts or wounds on the skin as this can cause painful stinging or burning
Avoid putting on any of the same clothing articles that were used while cooking for instance a heat or sweater
Use air freshening products
You can try using air diffusers air deodorizing sprays plug-ins or scented candles
Also of great use are air fresheners that allow you to spray on fabrics
Spray all items that are in the cooking vicinity until damp such as the carpet upholstery drapes or walls
A combination of many products will work well
Be sure to carefully read instructions on the packaging label to ensure proper use
Boil flowers or leaves that emit a pleasant fragrance
Put two cups of water in a pot on the stove and bring it to a boil
Add fragrant materials such as Kewra (Screwpine) leaves or vanilla beansextract and turn the heat down to a simmer
Allow it to simmer for at least one hour
The smell emitted will mask the lingering curry odor
Screwpine leaves are also known as pandan leaves and can be purchased at the local Asian grocer or specialty grocery store
There are no set specifications on how much screwpine or vanilla you should add
Try a few sprigs to begin with and add as needed
Allow fresh air into your home

You may also need to replace filters in your heating or cooling systems so they donâ€™t circulate odorous air
