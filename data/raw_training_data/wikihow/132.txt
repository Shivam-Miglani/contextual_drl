Time the preparation of mulch
Lay the mulch before planting your garden if you are using inorganic mulch such as cardboard paper or plastic
Prepare the ground
Use a garden hoe or tiller to turn up the soil of the garden
Water the garden
Use a garden hose to soak the garden thoroughly with water
Lay the mulch
Lay the cardboard paper or plastic in rows in the garden
Bend and bury the ends of each piece of cardboard paper or plastic in the ground
Burying the ends of the material will secure the mulch
Add the plants or seeds
Use scissors or a knife to cut holes or slits into the mulch where you will place your plants or seeds in the ground
Use a garden trowel to hollow out areas in the ground beneath the holes or slits for your plants or seeds
Cut extra slits into the mulch to allow water to reach the ground beneath the mulch
Place your plants or seeds into the hollowed-out ground beneath the holes or slits
Cover the seeds or the roots of the plants with dirt
Water the plants or seeds thoroughly
