Wipe with a damp cloth or sponge
Use a soft cloth and water to gently wipe down all surfaces of wicker to remove dirt and retain shine
Try using a mild soap on your cloth or sponge for more stubborn dirt and stains on your wicker but follow by wiping with just water afterwards
You can also add salt to water as a non-abrasive way to gently scrub away dirt and stains
Add a mixture of one part white vinegar to three parts water on your cloth if you need to eliminate mold or mildew built up on the wicker
Wash cushions separately
Remove any cushions or other material that is not made of wicker and clean separately
Check to see if cushions have a tag with care instructions
You may be able to put the entire cushion or a removable cover into a washing machine
When in doubt opt for gently dabbing at cushion fabric with a damp cloth and a small amount of gentle soap or stain remover
Hose down outdoor wicker furniture
Wipe outdoor furniture with a wet cloth or sponge and soap then rinse with a hose
Never hose down paper fiber wicker as it will easily be destroyed by a large amount of water
Washing should mainly be done with care on natural reed or synthetic wicker
If possible tilt your piece of furniture so that any area with a tighter weave of the wicker is on top
This way water will run down from it to the looser weave where it can be wiped away or dried more easily without keeping moisture trapped inside the weave
Steam-clean outdoor wicker furniture with a hand steam-cleaner if it is very dirty
Make sure that you dry the wicker right away with a hair dryer or full sun and wind to avoid the wicker warping or bending
Let the wicker dry
Ensure that the wicker is fully dry after washing and before replacing cushions or using the furniture again
Keep the furniture in a dry place indoors outside in the sun in dry conditions or use a fan or hairdryer at some distance away from the wicker to accelerate drying
Keep the shape of the wicker as best as possible
Avoid sitting or placing any objects on the furniture before it is completely dry as the wicker may form a new shape when wet
Expect to wait several days for the wicker to dry entirely
