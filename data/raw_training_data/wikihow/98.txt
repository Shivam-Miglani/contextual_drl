Stick to warm colors
Try out wall color in dusty shades and warm colors evocative of the desert or cooking spices
Choose a main color that you can complement with other decor in the room
Try out reds terracotta or orange colors yellows and golds
Accent with cooler turquoise silver and greens
You can also stick to more neutral warm colors for the walls if you plan to accent with a lot of colorful tapestries rugs wall hangings and cushions
Paint the ceiling
Don’t leave out the ceiling when you paint all four walls of your room
This will add extra color and richness to the overall look
If possible you can even create patterns with stencils or by freehand on the ceiling reminiscent of the beautifully decorated ceilings of the East
Do the ceiling in the same shade as the walls or a lighter complementary color
Choose a lighter color to visually expand the height or a darker one to create a closer cozy atmosphere for the room
Create an accent wall
Bring some extra color and drama to a room with a statement wall that is a different color or shade from the other three walls
Try a pattern a complementary color or a contrasting color
Choose as your accent wall the one that has any interesting architectural details other built-in focal points or the most light
Try using a stencil to create a Moroccan-inspired pattern on your accent wall
Remember to paint the entire wall whatever color you want to show in the negative spaces of the stencil pattern be it a white or neutral or another warm complementary hue
Tape and paint with stencils
Affix pre-made stencils to an accent wall or ceiling to create a Moroccan pattern
Carefully tape a stencil to one portion of the surface paint then move it to the next portion to keep the pattern consistent
Try out a common pattern found in Moroccan art and textiles such as the eight-pointed star octagon and other repeated geometrical patterns
You can also create your own stencil by taping shapes onto a wall with painter’s tape
With both this and pre-made stencils you should always let paint dry completely before moving a stencil or removing tape
