Grab a felt or wood hanger
Wire hangers may work for everyday clothes but they will leave dents in your jersey over time
Instead use a solid smooth wood or felt hanger to support your jersey on the wall
Look for colors that match the jersey itself or the team’s colors
Mark the spot you want your jersey to hang from
Find a spot on your wall to hang your jersey from and make a small pencil mark where the hanger’s hook will sit
Look for areas where the jersey can hang down without touching the ground or furniture
To preserve the shirt over time hang it away from windows and rooms that get moist or humid
Place a small hook or command strip on the wall
Make sure the area over your marked spot is clean and clear of debris
For walls that can be altered push a small nail or hook into the plaster
For walls that cannot be altered stick a command strip on the surface instead making sure the hook lines up with pencil mark
Hang your jersey
Place the hanger inside your jersey and put it on the nail or hook
To add to your display try hanging a picture of yourself in uniform your favorite player or a piece of sporting equipment nearby
If your jersey is prone to slipping use small Glue Dots or similar adhesives to keep the fabric in place
