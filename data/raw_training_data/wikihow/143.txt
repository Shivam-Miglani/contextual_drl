Use large low furnishings to divide the room
To make a large living room more livable and less intimidating create two or more distinct sections
Backless or low-backed sofas especially L-shaped ones are excellent for dividing a room without blocking line of sight or creating odd tall distractions in the center of the space
Dividing a large rectangular space into two squares often improves its appearance as square spaces are almost always more appealing to the eye
You can use one or more sections for other purposes as though they weren't part of your living room although the overall color scheme should match
If your room is too small to divide comfortably fill space with oversize furniture
An extra large ottoman is better than a coffee table for making a large space between couches or chairs feel cozy
A small couch will feel out of place in a large room so replace a larger one or buy a second matching one and angle them slightly toward each other to form one side of your furniture arrangement
Use large wall art or multiple smaller pieces
If all your paintings or wall hangings are small place them in groups to make a large pleasing arrangement that fills visual space
Tapestries tend to be larger and cheaper than paintings
Add tall house plants to fill corners and bare areas
An indoor potted plant you're willing to care for can add color and visual interest where there used to be empty space
Place accessories on tables
Decorative figurines sculptures or ceramics draw attention to a smaller scale
Don't clutter the table so much it becomes unusable however one to four pieces on each one is sufficient
Paint or decorate the walls and ceiling
If you're interested in a complete redesign using rich colors wainscoting or multiple colors to make the space less bare
Drawing attention to the walls makes your guests feel encompassed by the space in an intimate environment
