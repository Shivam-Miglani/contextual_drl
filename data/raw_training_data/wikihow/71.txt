Decide on a theme
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles
Research your options
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers
A bouquet of flowers or balloons
Floating candles or rubber duckies
Building blocks and stuffed animals
Ask the parents for input
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys
Purchase or make your own centerpiece
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like
