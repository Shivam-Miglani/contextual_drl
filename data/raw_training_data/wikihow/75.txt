Keep the stovetop clean
Cooking on a regular basis leads to build-up from substances like leftover food and grease which can easily catch fire
Wipe up spills and clean the area regularly with white vinegar or any surface cleaner
Before events when you know you'll be cooking a lot such as parties and holidays give the stovetop and oven a thorough cleaning to prevent any disasters that could ruin the day
Different types of stovetops require different deep-cleaning techniques
On a glass stovetop use baking soda and a damp towel to soak and loosen the build-up before scraping it off
For coil burners remove and scrub the coils as well as the drip pans or replace the drip pan liners
With gas burner cooktops soak and scrub the grate in soapy water and use a vinegar and water mixture to scrub the cooktop
Use dish soap and a toothbrush to remove any stubborn grease build-up
Keep appliances clean
Just as with the counters check for grease or food build-up on your kitchen appliances such as toasters toaster ovens electric griddles and deep fryers
After many uses appliances can develop build-up of flammable substances
Use an oil-based cleaner or a mixture of concentrated liquid dish soap and baking soda to scrub away the grease and food
Regularly inspect and service your appliances
Regular inspections of your appliances whether you do it yourself or hire a professional are also important to determine whether the items need servicing
Completing an inspection yourself may save you some money but it is a lengthy and involved process and if you are not an expert you may miss some important details
One quick inspection you can easily do yourself is to examine electrical cords occasionally to make sure they're not broken or frayed
If the cords are compromised replace them
Check your smoke detectors
Make sure you have working smoke detectors on all floors of your home
You should have a smoke detector either inside or just outside of your kitchen
Sometimes harmless incidents in the kitchen can set off the alarm leading people to turn off the detector or remove it
If this happens be sure to re-attach the detector and turn it back on to be prepared for any future incidents
Unplug electric appliances when youâ€™re not using them
Even when appliances are turned off they still draw an electrical current
If the product is faulty or defective leaving it plugged in can start an electrical fire
Develop a habit of unplugging all appliances before you go to bed or leave for long trips
When you do use the appliances plug them straight into the electrical outlet
Never use an extension cord or power strips as these may overheat and start a fire
