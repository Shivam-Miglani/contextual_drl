Remove each flower as it fades
Once a flower has faded cut the flower where it meets the main stalk with a clean knife or scissors
Make sure to remove the green lump and thin green stem attaching the flower to the stalk
Cut the flower stalks once they yellow or sag
The main stalks contain food and water the plant can use but they will likely begin to droop or turn yellow shortly after the flowers fade
Be careful not to cut the leaves or the top of the bulb
Only the flower stalks should be removed
Do not be alarmed if sap runs out of the cut
This is normal for a well-watered plant
Move the amaryllis to an area with bright indirect light
Most people with amaryllis plants keep them indoors while they bloom in winter
If this is the case move the plant to a windowsill with indirect sunlight to let it adjust to increased sunlight
Pick a spot that is bright and receives lots of sunlight but not by direct exposure
You may skip this step if the plant was already exposed to indirect or full sunlight
In the northern hemisphere north and east facing windows receive indirect sunlight
In the southern hemisphere south and east facing windows do
Make sure to keep the plant relatively cool too at about room temperature
This is around or slightly warmer than 60 degrees F
Water the soil whenever it begins to dry
Your amaryllis will likely require daily watering unless kept in a humid environment or planted outside in moist soil
Don't let the soil dry out completely at least not for longer than a few hours
Youâ€™ll want to keep the soil just slightly moist at all times
After growth begins also fertilize the plant with a half-strength water-soluble fertilizer every two or three weeks
Continue on to the summer section as soon as the weather becomes warm
Depending on your local climate this typically begins in May or June in the northern hemisphere
In the southern hemisphere warm weather usually begins in December or January
