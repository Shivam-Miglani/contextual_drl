Mix the concrete
This can be done by hand or with a mixer
Always follow the directions on the bags of concrete
They will list how much water you need and how you should mix it
You can calculate the number of bags you will need by determining the cubic yards of the patio site
Multiply the thickness the width and the height of the area to determine how many bags you will need
You can also use a concrete calculator like this
If mixing by hand you can put the concrete mix into a mortar tub or a wheelbarrow
Mix with a shovel or a hoe
Make sure that when mixing concrete by hand you wear gloves and protective eye wear
If using a mixer make sure you can move the mixer into the area where you are building the patio
Do this before you begin the project
The amount of concrete needed for the project should determine whether you can mix by hand or with a mixer
Pour the concrete
Do this all at once to avoid independent shifting and settling of slabs
If using a wheelbarrow make a ramp so you can pour the concrete into the area
Make sure the ramp does not move or disturb the forms
Ramps can be made with 2x4s or other long pieces of wood
Getting help from others will help with this step
Have someone shovel out the concrete as you hold the wheelbarrow
Push the concrete into all corners with a shovel
Concrete is heavy so make sure to dump it close to where you want it
If the area is large you might want to use a longer tool to spread hard to reach inside areas or wear rubber boots to walk in the concrete as you spread
Use a flat piece of wood or aluminum screed (a long 2x4) to level the top of the concrete
Work from one end of the patio to the other in a sawing motion
This is easiest done with another person
Use a bull float to smooth the concrete surface
Move the float back and forth to smooth the patio and to fill in low spots
Water will float to the surface during this process
Wait until the water disappears to finish the patio
Put on the finishing touches
Using an edger slide it between the forms and the concrete to create a rounded edge
When the concrete can support your weight cut grooves in the concrete every 8 feet
These are control joints that help if the concrete shifts or changes over time
The final step is to hand float the concrete with a steel or magnesium float to finish smoothing the surface out
Let the concrete cure for at least two days
Cover the concrete with plastic or a curing compound to ensure it stays moist
After the concrete cures remove the form boards
Be careful during this process you don't want to chip your newly laid concrete
