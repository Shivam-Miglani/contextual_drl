Purchase a large shadow box display case
Look for a shallow shadow box or similar container making sure it is deep enough to hold your shirt and any other objects you will be framing with it
Look for border colors that match the jersey itself or the room it will be displayed in
Choose a square shadow box if you plan on folding the shirt to show just the number
Choose a tall rectangular shadow box if you plan on showing the whole jersey
Remove the shadow box’s backing board
Store-bought shadow boxes come with a backing board typically made of cork or thin wood
Remove this like you would the backing of a picture frame and lay it on a flat surface
To spice up a backing board try covering it with cloth or paper that shares or contrasts with the jersey’s colors
Use double-sided fabric tape to attach your shirt to the board
Whether you’re folding it into a square or displaying an entire side you will secure your jersey with the same basic method
Use strips of double-sided fabric tape to attach the body of your jersey to the board
Press down firmly on the board to make sure the shirt is secure
Use dressmaker pins to hold loose fabric down
Press small dressmaker pins through the jersey to hold any loose fabric down
Look for spots that will be hidden from view such as inside the sleeves and shoulders
Cover exposed pin points with fabric tape
Attach other decorations to the board if you want to
If you have extra room try adding some related elements to the shadow box
Small light objects can be attached just like the jersey itself
For larger heavier objects try attaching them with velcro straps or twine
In some cases items can be rested against the base of the shadow box itself
For personal jerseys try adding equipment you used while playing like gloves balls or pucks
For fan jerseys try adding team memorabilia like flags or player memorabilia like collectible cards
Place a nail or hook on the wall
Look at the reverse side of your backing board to see what kind of mount it uses
In most cases this will be a generic nail mount
For walls you can alter find the spot you wish to hang your jersey from and insert a nail or whatever object the mount requires
For walls you can’t alter use a command strip instead
For heavy boxes make sure to use a strong nail or hook to support the frame’s weight
Replace the backing board and hang your jersey
When your arrangement is ready reattach the backing board to your shadow box
Be careful not to bump or alter the objects inside while doing so
Then hang the frame and enjoy your new decor
