Cover your foundation vents
One of the easiest ways for possums to sneak into your home is through the dryer vent or other vents along the foundation
Block possums from sneaking in through these openings by covering them with slotted metal vent covers
These covers are screwed onto the vent and have just enough room for steam and smoke to escape but not enough for possums to sneak through
Trim tree branches
Possums can sneak onto the roof if tree branches or other tall plants are positioned nearby
Tree branches should be trimmed a minimum of 10 ft (305 m) away from the roof
Do not place climbing plants near the house especially not near the eaves areas
Protect low decks
Possums have been known to hide out under low decks so these should also be protected with some form of metal barrier
Use 14-inch (635-mm) grid screening or solid metal flashing
Dig a trench around the perimeter of the deck
The hole should be at least 12 inches (305 cm) deep
Place the screening or flashing in the trench
The barrier should extend from the bottom of the hole to the bottom or underside of the deck
Fill the trench in with dirt packing it down in place to prevent the screening from being jolted or wiggled around
Attach the top of the screening to the deck
Nails or fence post staples usually work best
Create a temporary one-way exit for any trapped possums to escape through
If you suspect that possums might be trapped below your deck provide them with a temporary means of escape
Instead of sealing up the final section of screening use 14-inch (635-mm) grid screening to form a funnel
The large end should be big enough for a possum to fit through and should be attached to the barrier using nails or fence post staples
The small end should extend away from the building and should have a hole roughly 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) in diameter
This will allow possums to squeeze their way out but not squeeze their way in
Keep this passage open for a few days to one week before sealing up the hole
Seal any other open spaces
Your home may have other open spaces that will appear inviting to a possum looking for a warm home or a free meal
Attic vents and chimneys should be covered with 14-inch (635-mm) grid screening
You could also use insect screening over the vents or you have a chimney cap installed
Repair any holes in deck lattices window screens or door screens
If you live in a mobile home cover the open space below the home with wire cloth
Make sure that the barrier extends from the ground all the way up to the bottom of the trailer
Cement block and wood lattice can also be used
Lock or cover pet doors at night
