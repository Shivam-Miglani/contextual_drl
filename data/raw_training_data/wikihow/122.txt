Remove everything from the pantry
In order to clean the pantry thoroughly it needs to be empty
Throw away infested food
Any food that shows clear signs of contamination should be discarded
If an open bag of grains or dry food does not appear to be infested but you still have concerns you can either discard the food or place it in the freezer for a week
The cold temperatures will kill any moth eggs that you cannot detect with the naked eye
Note however that you should not do this if you can spot larvae or adult pantry moths
Vacuum out the pantry
Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose and an angular nozzle attachment to clean the walls baseboard and corners of the pantry or cupboard
Clean under all shelving liners
Remove any old liners and vacuum beneath them
If the liners are in bad shape you may need to replace them
Focus on areas with webbing larvae or adult moths but vacuum the entire area
This includes all hardware wire shelves and pin holes in the cupboard
Scrub the pantry with soap and hot water
Use a dish towel or sponge to wash the walls floors doors and shelves of the pantry or cupboard
Make sure that you get the door hinges and door jamb as these spots are the most common hiding places for larvae
You should also scrub beneath any shelving liners or interior racks
Wiping cabinetry down with a rag or paper towel soaked in bleach before scrubbing cabinetry with hot soapy water increases the effectiveness of this method
Be careful to have good ventilation if you choose to do this
Wash old containers in hot soapy water
If you have plastic food containers currently in your pantry wash them in a dishwasher or use hot water and dish soap to scrub them out thoroughly
This is an essential step if the containers were exposed directly to the pantry moths but even if there were no pantry moths inside the container it is still a good idea to temporarily remove the contents of the container and wash it
Doing so will also allow you to more closely examine the contents for evidence of infestation
Dry everything thoroughly
Before putting everything back into the pantry dry the inside of the pantry with clean dish towels or paper towels
Also dry any food containers completely before putting food back in them and returning the containers to the pantry or cupboard
Pantry moths thrive on moisture so keeping things dry is an important part of getting rid of the pests
Take the trash outside
The vacuum bag and any trash bags containing infested food should be immediately removed from the kitchen and taken outside
If possible place the bags on the curb or in an area that does not share a wall with your house
