People have different ideas about what might be a romantic bedroom
For some people an uncluttered room with a few choice items and art pieces on the wall is much more appealing than a room with more traditional “romantic” decor like lace tulle and muted or pastel colors
If you share your bedroom consult your partner
It needs to be a place that both of you find romantic and comfortable
Some questions that you and your partner might need to think about before you begin What is your idea of romantic
Is it overtly sexy or more cool and understated
Will the room be private or will people other than you and your partner enter it at times
Do you use your bedroom to work on the computer watch tv or other activities that could be done elsewhere
Decide how much work you’re willing to do
Are you going to buy all new furniture and repaint or wallpaper your room
Or are you looking for a few key pieces that will make the room more romantic
Before you begin you need to create a budget and have an idea of what you are going to accomplish
Again if you are sharing your bedroom with a partner consult him or her about your plans
Make a model
If you’re completely redoing the room consider creating a model of how you want it to look and where furniture is going to be placed
It might be as simple as some sketches and a floorplan on a paper or you might want to make some computer drawings of your plan
Try a free 3-D sketching program that can give you a complete picture of what your completed room could look like
Choose a color scheme
Even if you’re just thinking in terms of a new comforter set and some new curtains new colors in your bedroom can significantly help change the feel of any room
Think about what you find romantic -- do you lean more toward muted and pastel colors or splashes of strong or bold color
Will you be using black or white as a contrasting color
If you’re going to be painting the room go to the hardware store to check out some paint colors -- this can be a good way to get inspiration
Think about it being first and foremost a place where you will sleep and choose colors that can help you and your partner be both passionate and relaxed
Some possible combinations might be Traditional romantic -- pink white cream Beach getaway -- sand turquoise pink Retro cool -- beige blue black Dramatic sexy -- red gold black Country house -- lavender green white
