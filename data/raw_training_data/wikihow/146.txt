Give your walls a fresh coat of paint or apply some wallpaper
You can also paint the walls a solid color first and then paste on a narrow strip of wallpaper going around the room
The strip can be in the center of the wall or towards the top
If you can't paint the walls or change the wallpaper tack some fabric to the wall instead
Try to get it as smooth as possible
If you have a small room consider painting your walls one color and leaving the ceiling white
This will make your room look bigger
Consider having an accent wall
Instead of painting your entire room one color paint three walls white or off-white and the fourth wall a darker contrasting color
Place all of your statement furniture against this wall
Add some designs with wall stencils
Choose a base color for the background and a contrasting color for the designs
Paint the background color first let it dry then apply the designs with more paint and stencils
If you live in a rental unit use wall decals instead
They are giant vinyl stickers that peel off easily when it is time to move out
Hang up some posters photos or artwork
This is great for those who are on a budget or are unable to repaint their rooms
If you are living in a rental unit use double-sided mounting tape stick-on mounting hooks or poster puttytack instead
If you are hanging the wall art above your bed consider matching it to your bed linens
For example if your wall art has a white background with blue flowers consider getting white bed linens with blue flowers on them as well
Save space by getting items that can be fixed to the wall
Nightstands and adjustable lamps can be affixed to walls and are a great way to save space
You can also put some shelves above your bed to store some of your favorite personal items as well
Hang some fairy lights or string lights on the walls
You can use ordinary Christmas lights or decorative ones
Decorative lights come in all different shapes and sizes and can be found in shops that sell light fixtures and room d√©cor
They come in all sorts of shapes sizes and colors such as flowers and butterflies
If your room has white or light-colored walls choose lights with a white or clear wire
If your room has darker-colored walls choose lights with a clear wire
