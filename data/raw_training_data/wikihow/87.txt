Cut the stem above the leaf growth
When harvesting red clover flower for personal consumption cut the stem above the leaf growth
After cutting the stem from the plant you’ll want to remove any remaining stem from the flower itself
Cut leaves
Leaves may be cut from the stem in clumps of three
When cutting the leaves (or the flower) avoid cutting the entire plant at its base
While the plant can regrow more leaves and stems you’ll hurt its ability to produce if you cut it too low
Remember don’t waste any part of the plant you won’t use
Avoid plants with discolored flowers or leaves
Plants with discolored flowers or leaves could be sickly
Harvesting sick or weak plants could not only hurt the plant (and make it so the plant can’t recover from the harvest) but it could impact the flavor and quality of whatever you produce with it
Allow plants with discolored flowers or leaves to grow until the next season
If they still appear discolored uproot them
Place your harvest on trays or racks to dry
Unless you choose to eat the leaves or flowers when they are fresh you need to dry out your harvest so you can store it properly
To do this place wire racks or trays with leaves and flowers in a shaded area
Then allow them to turn crisp
Make sure wherever you lay your harvest is not too moist or humid
Your harvest could mold or mildew
If you want to speed up the drying process consider placing your harvest in a dehydrator
Put your dried clover into an airtight container
After you’ve dried your clover leaves or flowers you need to store them appropriately
Gently place them into some sort of airtight container
When you’re done close the container as tight as you can
Use mason jars Tupperware or other similar containers
Store your red clover in a shaded dry and cool location
Take your containers full of dried red clover and place them in a part of your house that is cool and dry
This is important as the cooler and dryer the location the higher the chances that you’ll be able to store your clover for a substantial period of time
Store your red clover in a place with temperatures lower than 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) and 60% humidity
