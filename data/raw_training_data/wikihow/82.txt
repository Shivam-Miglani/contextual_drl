Punch holes with a garden fork
For small grassy areas a small metal garden fork or sandals with spikes in the bottoms are enough to poke holes in the soil
Aeration holes let in air water and roots
Start on one side of the lawn and push the fork into the ground in one direction every few inches or eight to ten centimeters
You may need to repeat the process in a different direction to achieve aeration
Dig up compaction
Loosen the compaction by digging up two or three inches of dirt with a shovel
Take a spade and divide the soil into small rows about a foot wide
Dig small trenches behind these rows then use the rows of soil to replace the dirt removed from the trenches
For poor soil you may need to dig deeper about two spade-lengths to help aerate the top layer and mix it with better soil
Get a rototiller with an aeration attachment
Buy or rent a rototiller from a lawn and garden or home improvement store and consider getting an aeration attachment for it
Run the tiller over the soil then run it over again two or three times using it to cut deeper
Tillers arenâ€™t as effective on large areas as coring machines since they only break up the top layer of soil
Tilling too regularly actually contributes to soil compaction because it creates a hard pan of soil below the tilled area
Remove soil cores
Plug aerators are heavy machines that are useful for large areas of foot traffic such as lawns or fields
Rent the machine from a home and garden store then set the machine against moist soil
As it rolls across the soil it will pull out a core of dirt then move it two or three inches away
Repeat throughout the area
Let the removed soil plugs dry before breaking and scattering them
Badly compacted areas require multiple passes of the aerating machine
Mark off any areas where pipes and roots run close to the surface
The aeration plugs should only be a couple of inches deep but it can still damage these structures
There are also hand held aerators which you push into the soil manually and then move which may be better for smaller lawns or gardens
Replace the soil
This is an intensive solution and is mostly used for small areas to reintroduce grass
Dig up the compacted soil by hand or by machine
You can gather the soil into a planting mound nearby or bury it in good soil
Bring in new topsoil and spread it over the area
Check with your lawn and garden or home improvement store for a soil that has the qualities to nurture plant growth
The larger the plant the more replacement soil it will need to flourish
Trees and shrubs require 15 inches to three feet of replacement soil
