Choose a color theme
Your table will be much more cohesive if there is a theme to your decorations
The theme can be either a color or an event such as a birthday a season or a specific holiday
If the theme is a color instead of an event limit yourself to 2-3 colors that go well together
If the theme is a holiday choose colors that correspond with that holiday
For example if it is a Christmas buffet use decorations that are red green and gold
Buy or make items related to your theme
Create a centerpiece that incorporates your theme using fruit flowers props or candles
You can then choose items that hint at that theme for the rest of the table such as edible garnish flowers fruit leaves or cinnamon sticks
Some other ideas for table decorations depending on your theme are ribbons or seashells
Avoid overdoing the decorations
You want the decorations to be classy not gaudy or overwhelming
Ideally the food will be on display and any d√©cor around the table will enhance the look of the food not hide it or overwhelm it
Also avoid sprinkling the table with glitter or other non-edible decorations as these often end up on people's plates or in their mouths
Coordinate your tablecloth a table runner napkins and placemats
Choose either a tablecloth or a table runner to place beneath the food on the buffet table
Napkins are a must as well
Placemats are optional but can be a nice touch to have beneath your serving dishes
When choosing these items be sure that they are within your color scheme and that they go well with one another
Consider oversized cloth napkins in colors that match your theme
For a more casual buffet paper napkins are just fine
No matter what supply plenty of spare napkins in case of a mess
Table runners should hang about 6 inches (15 cm) down the table on both sides
Prepare a label for each food item
Make labels for each dish that you will have on the table
Use cardstock or paper folded in half with the name of the dish written on one side
Write or type in a bold clear font that is large enough for any guest to read
Write whether a dish is vegetarian vegan or gluten free on the label beneath the name of the dish
Consider making a menu to display
For an extra touch you can create a menu of all the different foods that will be served
Display the menu either using a small menu easel on the table or a stand beside the beginning of the table
That way guests will know what they will find further down the table and can make more informed food choices
