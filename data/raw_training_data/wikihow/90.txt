Mark out your flower beds
Before you start planting mark out the edges of your planned flower beds
You can do this with a garden hose or even with a little flour or lime
Plan to make your beds at least 2-3 feet (6-9 meters) wide so there is plenty of room for your flowers
Flower beds can be laid out along fences walls or the edges of walkways
You can also build circular flower beds around the bases of trees
You can also build an “island” flower bed in the middle of your lawn
Prepare your soil
Once you have marked out where your beds will be prepare the areas for planting
This will involve clearing out any plants that are already growing in the area and making sure the soil is aerated and full of nutrients
Dig up the top 1-2 inches (25-5 cm) of sod making sure to dig out all grass and weeds by the roots
Break up and turn over the soil with a shovel or rotary tiller
Remove any rocks or other large objects that you dig up
If you need to add fertilizer compost or other components to the soil
Turn the soil again and lightly water it
Arrange flowers by height
In general your garden will look best if you place the tallest flowers at the back of the bed and the shortest at the front
This way your view of (and access to) the shorter flowers will not be blocked by the taller ones
For flowers planted in an “island” bed taller flowers can be placed in the center with shorter flowers around the edges
Plant flowers in natural-looking groups
For a rustic spontaneous look try not to plant your flowers in rigid formations or patterns
Avoid extremely straight rows and groups of alternating colors
Instead plant your flowers in loose clusters (small circular groups) or drifts (long loose rows) of intermingling colors
Install a trellis for climbing flowers
A wood or wrought-iron trellis can add an attractive rustic touch to your garden
Dress up a plain wall or fence in your yard by setting up a trellis and planting it with climbing roses or morning glories
If you don’t want to buy or build an elaborate trellis you can try making trellises from repurposed objects like vintage wagon wheels or old gardening tools
Mix in planters with ground-planted flowers
You can add interest to your garden by putting a few planters in among the flowers in your beds
Try planting some trailing flowers or vines in a wooden keg barrel
