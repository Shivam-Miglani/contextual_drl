Use seasonal items
You can give your home a festive touch without going overboard simply by displaying some seasonal or holiday-related items on a tiered tray
Take a look at your calendar and note any holidays that are coming up
Choose a holiday then find items related to that holiday
Choose functional items
If you are keeping your tray in the kitchen use it to display items you frequently use such as mugs tea cups or fruit
If you are keeping yours in the bathroom or bedroom use it to display other items such as makeup and nail polish
Make it personal with some meaningful words
Try carved wooden phrases or letters
You can leave them plain or decorate them with paint scrapbooking paper rhinestones etc

Add some holiday-themed treats
