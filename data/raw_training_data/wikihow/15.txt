Allow soil to dry out between watering
Catnip plants like drier soil and root rot can set in if the soil is too moist
When you water thoroughly soak the soil to saturate the roots
Let the soil dry out completely and test it out by touching a finger to it before watering
If the soil feels moist or wet don’t water the plant and check it later that day or the next day
Catnip plants are fairly hardy and quite drought-resistant so you should be more concerned about over-watering than not watering them enough
Shear and deadhead plants to promote new growth
After your plant's first flower blooms finish remove the spent flowers
Shear back the plants by one-third to promote new growth and a new bloom of flowers
Remove any dead or dried leaves regularly
Shearing and deadheading plants will result in bushier plants that flower more consistently
Divide root systems in the spring or fall
You can propagate or make new plants by dividing one plant’s root system
Dig up a cluster of plants with at least two to three stalks or remove them from their pot if you used a container
Soak the root ball to the point of complete saturation
Use a clean trowel or garden knife to divide the root cluster in half then replant each new plant
Continue to water frequently after you’ve divided the plants
Don’t let the root system dry out as you would with a normal catnip plant
Dividing plants can help control overgrowth renew fading plants or simply allow you to share a plant with a friend
Keep your kitty from damaging it or nearby plants
Cats are of course attracted to catnip plants and love to nip at their leaves and lay in plant beds
If you have an outdoor cat don’t plant catnip next to delicate flowers or plants you wouldn’t want your cat to damage
If using containers avoid positioning pots in places where they might easily be knocked over or broken
Consider using garden fencing bracing or bamboo sticks to support the plants and prevent your cat from laying on them
Harvest and air dry leaves
To harvest trim down a stalk to its base or just above a leaf joint or cut off the whole plant at the base
Cutting just above a joint or where a leaf or leaves spring from the stalk will promote more rapid new growth
Air drying is the best drying method for preserving catnip leaves
Let your leaves sit out on a paper towel beneath a sunlit windowsill for two or three days
For whole plants hang them upside down in a cool location for a few weeks
Do your best to keep your cat away from your drying leaves
Consider a room with a closed door to keep the cat from jumping up and getting into the leaves
Once they’ve dried place them in an airtight container for storage
