Choose a color scheme
It's your den so choose colors that make you relaxed
Keep in mind that dark walls make a room look smaller which may make a small den feel cramped
A large den on the other hand might benefit from the coziness of dark wall paint
If you're not sure what to choose go with a neutral color for the wall paint
Cream light gray or light brown are unobjectionable and work with most furniture
If the walls are already painted and you're not sure which colors they go with get white or light-colored furniture
You can easily add color later with cushions and throws
Bright fluorescent colors are harsh on the eye especially reds oranges and yellows
Even in a bright high-energy den keep these to pillows and throw rugs not entire walls and couches
Divide the room with rugs
If you have a large open plan den start by deciding how to divide it
One easy way to do this is to lay down one rug for each area of the den
For instance lay down one rug where couches will surround it and another where the game table will go
Thick plush rugs make the den more comfortable and luxurious
Choose a focal point
Each room or area of a room should have a focal point to design around
For a den this is usually a television or fireplace
If you don't have any large objects like this choose a wall and make it stand apart with a different color heavy curtains or large wall art
Arrange furniture around the focal point
Arrange seating so it faces the focal point but place it in a semi-circle or rectangle to encourage conversation
L-shaped couches work great here
Provide coffee tables or side tables within reach of each seat
Add additional seating
Assuming there's room keep a couple comfortable chairs or a small couch arranged away from the focal point for people who prefer solitary activities such as reading
Address other needs
You might need a television bookcase or gaming table depending on what you use the den for
For extra fun install a movie projector or a minibar
Arrange the lighting
Place a lamp about every ten feet (3 meters) throughout the den or next to any reading seats
Keep the overhead lighting warm and consider installing a dimmer switch
Harsh overhead lighting kills any sense of comfort
Finish with additional decor
To add more color and coziness to the room add pillows and decorative objects
Decorative glass jars candles and flowers are all good ways to add color
For a more austere look go with a small number of objects all in the same shade
Decorate the walls as well
Wall hangings paintings or photographs add character to the room
