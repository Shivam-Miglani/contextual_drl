Sand any wooden pieces
If your chimes have wooden tubes or a wooden clapper that you want to refinish you’ll need to remove any dirt or old finish
Take a piece of light-grade sandpaper and go over the outside of the wooden pieces by hand until they look clean and even in appearance
If you are replacing any wooden parts make sure to sand the new pieces as well
Get creative with a paint design
You can paint either wooden or metal chimes
Spray paints intended for metal and outdoor use will work best
You can decide on whatever design strikes your fancy
For instance you could Make two-tone or three-tone tubes by painting parts of the different colors
Use one color for the tube’s base then use a contrasting one to create stripes or spots for variety
Give each tube a different color
Paint the clapper one color and the tubes another
Paint all the tubes a single solid color
Stain wooden chimes if you prefer
You can use just about any wood stain or oil finish you like for this job
Since chimes are a relatively small project you could look for stain wipes at your hardware store instead of cans of stain
Simply wipe them over the pieces instead of brushing the stain on
Set up a finishing station and give your chimes a new life
If you’re painting or staining your chimes a single color you could just lay the pieces flat on a piece of newspaper
Paint or stain one side then let it dry
Flip or roll the pieces over and finish the other side
If you have a more complicated design or want to work faster you could stand the tubes up and finish them that way
Lay newspaper on the ground then poke pencils or similar objects through the paper and into the soil
Place the tubes upright over the pencils and they will stand in place as you work and let the pieces dry
Place toothpicks in the holes where the strings go
This will prevent them from clogging with paint or stain as you work
Seal your chimes
This will protect them against weathering and damage
A spray-on clear coat protective finish is a good quick option that works for paint or stain finishes
You can also use a brush-on polyurethane finish for wood if you prefer
