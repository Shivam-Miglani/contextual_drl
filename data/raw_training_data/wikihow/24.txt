Choose the space
Naturally the word "cave" is very loosely used in the case of developing a man cave
It can be the attic an unused bathroom the shed out the back the garage or the basement
Or anywhere else that's spare has adequate elbow room and is left currently unused or pretty much abandoned
Build a shed or dig out a basement if your options are looking thin
Be prepared to negotiate
Having a man cave in the house may require delicate household negotiations and compromises
You may have to agree to something in exchange for your man cave been allowed into the house
If your man cave is using up the only relaxation space no one's going to end up happy
Try offering one of the following in exchange if your partner or housemate is interested Setting up another room as a sewing room exercise room sauna and spa playroom model collection space or astronomy observatory
Promising a certain number of hours each month on household repairs odd jobs or chores
Arranging regular dates or family time
Insulate and sound-proof the room
Man caves often start in corners of the house without insulation
Make your man cave warmer and more sound-proof by installing fiberglass or other insulation material between the wall studs
Unless your cave is in a stand-alone shed or you're living alone put a priority on sound proofing when choosing insulation material
You don't want your midnight sports or poker game to be interrupted by a tired spouse or neighbor
Paint or wallpaper the room (optional)
If you've been relegated to the dingiest smallest room in the house bright colors will give a sense of more light coming in and more space
On the other hand dark colors are good for home theater setups or a relaxed bar-like atmosphere
If you couldn't care less and just think a wall is a wall congratulations
Skipping this step is the first benefit of having a space where you get to make the decisions
Add lighting or curtains if needed
Install recessed lighting or a light on a dimmer switch if you want to watch movies in your man cave
If your man cave has windows put up blackout curtains so you can pull them closed and game at three in the afternoon without the outside world butting in
