Set a budget
What you choose will depend partially on how much you can spend
Calculate a reasonable estimate of what you can afford before you start making purchases
Consider balancing a small budget with different types of wallcoverings in different rooms or by combining materials
Remember that you can combine wallcoverings in the same room so if you really want an expensive wallpaper but can’t afford to cover your whole room in it consider doing one wall or part of your walls
For example you could make the smallest wall in your room a focal point with a fun print
Go with what draws your eye
You may notice that you keep picking up samples that look similar to each other or that the pictures you chose to use for inspiration fit the same style
If you find yourself drawn to a particular print or style trust your gut especially if you notice that your other belongings also fit that style
Going back to the same print or color over and over is a good sign that it’s the right choice for you
If you’ve gathered samples of wall coverings go through them to look for similarities between prints and colors to see if you’re picking the same thing repeatedly
Think about how you use the room
How you will use the room should help you determine which covering to choose
For example you may want to use a calmer print or color in your bedroom while your entertainment room can be covered in a more festive wallcovering
Make sure that bathroom wall coverings can resist moisture heat and cleaning
Look for durability in frequently cleaned rooms like your bathroom and kitchen as well as high-traffic rooms
For example a wall with light switches may show fingerprints and a wall that backs dining room chairs may receive furniture scuff marks
Choose child-friendly materials if you have children
For example wallpaper in a child’s room can be removed or colored on by your child
Use your wall covering to change the space
If there is something that you don’t like about a room such as it’s too dark small or boring choose a wall covering that eliminates what you hate
You can use prints or colors to make the space better fit your style needs or you can use design tricks to make the space look bigger
Lighter colors or thin vertical prints such as narrow stripes can make your room look larger
You could also make a small room look larger with a small print or a bright color
You could make a boring room fun with a stylish print
