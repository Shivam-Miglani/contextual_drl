Choose pillows that fit the area
If you are putting accent pillows on a sofa that is a typical size around 16”-18” x 16”-18” standard sized pillows will fit neatly in the space
Standard square accent pillows are around 18 inches
Having average sized pillows on your sofa will keep the area comfy looking but not overwhelmed by the pillows
If you have a larger sofa or a larger bed go for oversized square pillows which are around 24 inches
Oversized pillows can create a comfy feel and make the space more inviting
If your sofa has a low back and is slim go for square pillows that are 16 inches
This way the pillows do not overwhelm the sofa and still complement the size of the sofa well
Select pillows with contrasting shapes
Accent pillows come in four main shapes bolster square rectangle and round
Go for a mix of shapes to add dimension to the sofa or bed especially if the space is sparsely decorated
Rectangle shaped pillows are good for supporting your back and neck so they may be a good base shape for a bed or a sofa
Then add two round pillows or two bolster pillows to create variety on the bed or sofa
If you have a couch made of leather bolster pillows are a good option as they provide lumbar support and won’t slip down when propped up on the couch
If your bed or couch has severe or sharp lines with very little padding soften it with round pillows
If the bed or couch is more soft and squishy sharpen it with large square pillows
Use pillows with texture
Contrasting textures can add a sense of design to the space
Look for pillows that will contrast the texture of your sofa or bed
Contrast a set of linen pillows against a smooth leather couch or pillows made of silk against a fuzzy couch or a bed
You can also use pillows that have a texture that will help them stay in place on your sofa or bed
For example you may go for pillows made of linen on a silk couch so they stay in place
Or you may use cotton accent pillows on linen sheets so there is traction and the pillows do not shift or move around
Select accent pillows with high quality filling
To ensure your accent pillows last and do not become lumpy or saggy go for ones with high quality filling
Cheaper accent pillows will be filled with feather foam or a synthetic mix
However if you plan to use the accent pillows to lean on or sleep on cheaper ones will not last
Instead go for accent pillows that contain goose down which is softer and higher quality
If you are a vegan or want a cruelty-free option for pillows you can try pillows made of high quality synthetic material
Pillows stuffed with wheat husks and cotton are also good options
