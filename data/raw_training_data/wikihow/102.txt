Prepare the statue for painting
Before painting concrete you must take certain steps to ensure the paint will stick to it Allow the concrete statue to air dry
Wash the statue with water using a garden hose or shower sprayer
Do not use soap
Blow any remaining dust or concrete flakes off the statue using a high pressure air hose
Apply a base coat to the entire statue using either a brush or a sprayer
Use either a latex exterior paint or a paint formulated especially for painting concrete in a color that is appropriate to the top coat color you will be using
Coat the bottom of the concrete statue with a base coat first
Allow it to dry then stand the statue up for painting
Allow the base coat to dry then inspect the statue for full coverage
Concrete is very absorbent so you may need to apply more than 1 base coat
If you notice that an area seems dull or washed out in comparison to other areas it is a good idea to apply another base coat
Choose a painting method for the top coat
You may opt to use a paint brush or paint sprayer to coat the statue or you can choose from other creative paint finish options Dry-brushing involves using base and top coats that are contrasting in nature and swiping a partially-coated paintbrush over the concrete statue to create a weathered striation effect
For example you can use a black base coat for your statue then dip your paintbrush in white paint wipe most of the white paint off the brush and swipe the barely-damp paintbrush across your statue for a feathery look
For an antiquing method use a light or white base coat for concrete statues then apply the colored top coat let the paint sit for 10 minutes and wipe away the excess paint using a dampened rag
Apply and wipe away paint as necessary to get the desired effect
Airbrushing is a technique that requires a paint airbrush
It is a learned skill that can create realistic effects for animal statues and can work with either a dark or light base coat depending on the subject
Detailing involves using small brushes to create details in the top coat by hand
Concrete statues that are going to be detailed generally work best with white base coats
Paint the top coat
You can either paint concrete statues a solid color or use a variety of colors for details
Use any type or variety of exterior latex paint andor concrete paint products found in home improvement and craft stores
Allow the top coat to dry for 24 hours before moving on to the next step in painting concrete
Seal the statue
Use a non-yellowing exterior concrete sealer
This will protect paint colors from fading and keep out harmful moisture
Place the concrete statue on a ventilated surface (gravel or rock will do) and allow the sealer to dry for 24 hours
