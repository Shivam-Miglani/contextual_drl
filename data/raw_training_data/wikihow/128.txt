Don't sit or lie down when smoking
Standing up will usually prevent you from falling asleep while smoking
Getting too tired
Put out the cigarette thoroughly in an ashtray or water-damp sink and go to bed
Do not smoke in bed - when you're in bed it's easy to fall asleep and drop your cigarette on the floor allowing it to set fire to the carpet
Cleaning out the ashtray
Place the ashes in the sink and dampen them then scoop them up and place them in the trash can away from the house
Take care when drying laundry on airers or dryers by the fire
Try not to do this unless totally unavoidable
Dry clothes by radiators or outdoors if possible
Be careful with candles oil lamps and other open flame illumination or decorations
Cover the flame with a wire cage to prevent something from falling or blowing onto the flame and to prevent children and pets from coming in contact with the flame
Extinguish any naked flames when leaving the room if even for a minute
After all you'll be right back and you can immediately relight the candle or lamp
Use caution with holiday decorations particularly Christmas trees
Natural Christmas trees are highly combustible when they become dry and old damaged or low quality tree lights cause many fires when combined with an under watered or otherwise dry tree
Watch a video of a Christmas tree fire
It is amazing how fast it can destroy a room and a home
After using matches quickly place in or run under water to extinguish any invisible flame or heat source that could cause a fire in the trash can
Take care using chargers for devices such as mobile phones
Unplug chargers when not in use
Unplug hair straighteners curling irons and other similar appliances after use
Don't just turn them off at the socket or switch the device itself off unplug it
