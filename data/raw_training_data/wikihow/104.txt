Measure the area around the broken window pane
Use a tape measure to get the length and width of the window frame
Measuring the area will help you determine how big your new piece of glass should be
Subtract 1⁄8 inch (032 cm) from the measurement
The additional space will ensure that the glass will fit in the window and won’t crack if the frame expands during cold weather
Purchase a new pane of glass
Go to a hardware or glass store with your measurements and buy a new piece of glass
They will cut your glass to your specifications
If the frame is made out of wood use a painter’s brush to apply a layer of wood sealer around the broken window frame
Let the sealer dry for one or two hours before moving onto the next step
Wood sealer will help the putty or glazing compound adhere to the wood and will help with weather-proofing your windows
Apply putty or a glazing compound around the frame
This will help hold your new pane of glass in place
If you’re using putty roll it in your hands to warm it up then apply it to the interior of the frame
If you’re using a glazing compound squeeze a tube of the compound onto the frame around the empty hole
If your compound came in a container use a putty knife to apply it
Don’t worry about laying too much putty or compound because you’ll be scraping the excess away later
You can purchase putty or a glazing compound from the hardware store or online
Push your new pane of glass into the empty opening
Take your new piece of glass and carefully press it into the opening
The glass should press against the putty and adhere to it
Reinsert any nails or clips that you removed earlier
Replace the clips or nails that you removed earlier by lightly tapping them back into the frame
This will help your pane of glass stay in place
Apply putty or glazing compound around the new window
Apply a layer of putty or compound around the edges of the new pane of glass
This will ensure that it's held in place with the putty on both sides of the window and will hold your new glass in place
Smooth the putty out and let it dry
Use a putty knife to smooth out the compound around the new window pane
Remove any excess putty or compound so that it runs flush with the frame and looks clean
Allow the putty to dry overnight so that it sets
Remember to smooth the putty on both sides of the window
