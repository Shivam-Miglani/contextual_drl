Make sure that any dirt dust or other forms of detritus are removed from your shipping container
We suggest using a strong bristled broom and work your way from the back end of the container
It may be dusty inside so we also recommend that you wear a dust mask of some form
If you have access to a pressure washer or can borrow or rent one it will expedite the cleaning process greatly
For safety we recommend wearing some type of goggles or safety glasses
You’re going to be working in a confined area and anything you spray loose may bounce around – eye protection is important
Again start at the back of the container and work your way towards the doors
Pay special attention to the corners and seams
Also keep an eye open for any signs of excessive wear in the floor
Once the inside dries you may want to consider repairing any potentially weak spots
After the inside is sprayed out we recommend cleaning the outside next
The high pressure hose will expose and possibly remove any loose paint or corrosion on your container
Inspect both the inside and outside of the shipping container for signs of rust or corrosion
If you do find any rust it can be treated with apple cider vinegar or white vinegar a natural rust remover
Apply the vinegar to the rust and rub it with a cloth or strong brush
If vinegar doesn’t do the trick or isn’t fast enough for you try rubbing the rust spots on your cargo container with aluminum foil
Once the container is completely dry inside and out go over the shipping container with a medium grit sandpaper
Either an orbital sander or belt sander will speed up the process
You don’t need to remove all of the paint but we do recommend attacking any spots on your container where the paint is peeling flaking or showing signs of wear
After you’ve finished sanding your shipping container apply a primer coat of paint
The primer coat will help give it a stronger seal and base to prevent any moisture or corrosion in the future
Finally after the primer coat is dry apply a thick exterior paint to the inside and outside of your storage container
Most exterior paints will work however if there’s any question it’s best to ask a professional or sales associate at the place where you purchased the paint
