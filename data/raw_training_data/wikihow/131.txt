Find a friend or neighbor who you trust
This person will have access to your lawn and in some cases your house (if you need indoor plants watered)
Make sure that you trust this person
If this person is watering indoor plants remember to leave behind a spare key so that they will have access to your plants
Be reasonable
Do not ask someone who lives far away or for whom getting to your place would be a big deal or hassle
Try to keep the visits to a minimum
Someone might be willing to visit your place once or twice a week but they might not be willing to visit it every single day especially if your home is out of the way for them
Consider using some homemade watering systems as well
This way your plants will rely on the homemade watering systems and all your neighbor will have to do is refill the bottles when they get empty
Group potted plants together based on watering needs
This will be easier for your neighbor to keep track of
For example you can keep all of the succulents in 1 area and the ivies in another
To keep your house clean consider storing the plants on a tray
Write down specific care and watering instructions
Be detailed but not complex and do not make assumptions
Your friend or neighbor may not have the same gardening skills as you do
What might seem like basic information to you might not even cross your friend or neighbor's mind
An example of specific watering instructions would include Give this plant Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of water every Saturday evening
An example of specific care instructions would include Tip the excess water out of the basil dish daily
Water check your plants for pests and disease before you leave
Watering your plants will reduce the amount of work or visits your plant sitter has to do
Checking your plants for pests or disease will ensure that they are healthy during your trip
If your plants succumb to pests or disease while you are away your friend or neighbor might be at a loss of what to do
If your plants die while under their care they may feel guilty!
Offer to return the favor
Even if you know that your friend or neighbor will say "no" it would still be polite to offer
This will reassure your friend or neighbor that you aren't just using them
They will also be more likely to help plant sit for you the next time you go on a trip
If they do accept your offer remember to hold up to it
