Water whenever the soil is dry during the growing season
During summer or any time the weather is warm and sunny aloe plants will grow fastest with regular watering
However it is much easier to overwater aloe plants than to dry them out so do not water until the soil has dried out to a depth of 3 inches (75 cm)
Water infrequently during the cold season
Aloe plants often go dormant during winter or when the weather is cold for a prolonged period of time
Unless you are keeping them in a heated room year round you should only water them once or twice a month during this period
Fertilize once a year or never
Aloe plants do not require fertilizer and overuse can harm the plant or cause it to grow in an unhealthy manner
If you wish to encourage growth use a low nitrogen high phosphorous low potassium fertilizer such as a 104010 or 153015
Apply once a year in late spring at the start of the growing season
Clear weeds carefully
The soil around the aloe plant should be free of grass and weeds
Remove these regularly if the plant is outdoors but do so carefully
Because good aloe soil is loose and sandy it is easy to damage the roots with vigorous weed-pulling
Increase sunlight if the leaves look flat and low
If the leaves are growing flat and low increase sunlight
Aloe vera leaves should grow upward or outward at an angle toward the sunlight
If they are low to the ground or growing flat outward the plant is probably not receiving enough sun
Move it to a sunnier area
If it is indoors consider keeping it outdoors during daylight hours
Decrease sunlight if the leaves turn brown
If the leaves turn brown decrease sunlight
While aloe is hardier than most plants when it comes to sun exposure it is still possible to burn the leaves
If the aloe plant turns brown move it to an area that receives shade during the early afternoon
Increase water if the leaves look thincurled
If the leaves are thin and curled increase water
The thick fleshy leaves store water that the plant uses in times of drought
If the leaves are looking thin or curling water the aloe plant more frequently
Be careful not to overcompensate water should drain quickly through the soil to prevent root rot which is difficult to stop
Stop watering if the leaves turn yellow or fall apart
Yellowed or "melting" leaves are suffering due to excess water
Stop watering altogether for the next week (or two weeks during the dormant season) and water less frequently once you resume
You may remove any discolored leaves from the plant without much chance of harm although it is best to use a disinfected knife
