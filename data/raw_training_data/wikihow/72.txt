Obtain used cooking oil
Locate a source for vegetable oil that has been used in cooking
Contact local fast food restaurants cafeterias hotels and other commercial food establishments to see if you can take their waste oil or pay a very small fee for it
You may compete with rendering companies who also pay restaurants to take used oil off their hands
Try a restaurant that sells a lot of fried food like French fries or fried chicken as they are very likely to have large quantities of used oil that they need to dispose of
Ask restaurants if they use canola or olive oil as these are typically the best oils for creating biodiesel
Avoid hydrogenated oils which are generally higher in Free Fatty Acids and cause problems in biodiesel production
You can buy new cooking oil from the grocery store but using waste oil is less expensive and helps reduce waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill or in sewer pipes
Examine the oil
Look at the oil you obtain to roughly determine its quality
It should look darker than fresh or unused vegetable oil and will likely include small food matter left from the frying process
If the oil appears milky or cloudy do not use it as it is likely too high in water content andor animal fats which will interfere in the biodiesel production process
Make sure to follow the proper procedures to dispose of cooking oil that you do not use
Contact your local waste management company or ask the restaurant you obtained the oil from to find out how they safely dispose of the oil
Pour your oil into clear plastic containers
Take any transparent plastic jug from juice soda or any other household product and pour your used oil into it for storage
Ensure that any storage jug is completely clean dry and free of any other residue or materials including water
Use a container with a tight lid and no cracks or leaks
The oil may already have come to you in an acceptable container when you obtained it from a restaurant or other source
However you will need several clean containers (at least 3) on hand for storing oil at each stage of the filtration process
Label oil containers and all other materials used in biodiesel production clearly
At this stage you can label the oil as “used oil” or “unfiltered oil” in order to avoid confusion in later steps of the process
