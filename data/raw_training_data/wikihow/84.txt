Consider using a towel soaked in rubbing alcohol immediately after exposure
The rash or blisters may not appear until as late as 48 hours after exposure so do not wait to do this
If you identify poison sumac and know you have been exposed pour rubbing alcohol over the affected skin as soon as possible
Because the toxin urushiol will not fully dissolve in alcohol using a paper towel or other solid material to rub the alcohol soaked skin may be necessary to remove a significant amount of the toxin
Warning the alcohol may temporarily make you more susceptible to further exposure by removing the protective oils on your skin
Avoid areas where poisonous plants grow for the next 24 hours after applying alcohol if possible
A better alternative is using a good surfactant to bind the oils before they penetrate the dermis of the skin Fels Naptha (old fashioned yellow soap available at a hardware store) or good ole Spic n Span wash the affected areas well scrub and rinse well
Do not touch any affected clothing as the oil will remain on the surface and readily transfer to skin
Wear disposable gloves during this process if your hands have not been exposed
Wash in cold water
Whether or not you applied alcohol scrub the exposed area with lots of cold water
Do not use warm water because it will open your pores and make the exposure worse
You may also use soap detergent or specialized products such as Tecnu but wash these off frequently so they do not dry on your skin along with any toxin they have picked up
Treat the rash with antihistamines or lotions
If you develop blisters or a rash you may take oral antihistamines to reduce the itching
You may also apply calamine hydrocortisone lotions or oatmeal baths for the same purpose
If you develop large oozing blisters you may wish to visit a doctor for prescription-strength treatment
Ooze from blisters does not contain the toxin so it cannot spread the rash
Seek medical attention in severe cases
If you suspect you inhaled poison sumac smoke seek medical attention immediately even if symptoms have not developed
Other serious situations that may require a doctor's attention include a rash on your face or genitals or a rash anywhere that fails to reduce in size after a week as well as eyes that are swollen shut or trouble breathing
Wash exposed tools and clothing
If you leave the sumac oil on tools or clothing they can spread the rash for months or years after the initial exposure
Put on disposable gloves and wash tools with soap and water rubbing alcohol or diluted bleach
Store clothes in disposable bags during transport then wash them in soap and hot water
