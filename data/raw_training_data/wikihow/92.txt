Drape garlands or tinsel
If you want to expand the door decorations beyond the door itself consider hanging seasonal garlands (often made from evergreen boughs or artificial pine-needles) or tinsel around the doorframe
You can also drape the seasonal garlands or tinsel around the exterior entryway or porch of your home
Hang the garlands or tinsel using push-pins to avoid the unsightly holes that nails or screws will leave in your woodwork
Add wintery paraphernalia around the doorframe
Make the most of your space by decorating not only the doorframe itself but also the area in beside the door with larger items that will be easily noticed
Place a large nativity scene or Santa or nutcracker doll beside the door
If you’d prefer a more woodsy look stack birch or aspen logs beside your door
If you’ve chosen a decorative theme—which could include snow and snowflakes Christmas ornaments woodsy evergreens or a rustic look—make sure that your decorations around the doorframe are consistent with the theme
Use white spray paint to create a faux-snow look
If you live in an area that’s unlikely to receive snowfall during the winter but still want your seasonal decorations to look wintery consider spraying items such as an evergreen wreath or Christmas garlands with a white or silver spray paint
A touch of white will make your decorations look woodsy and wintery
Holiday or craft stores will also sell sprays designed to look like thick snow
If you’d prefer more of a textured look purchase a can of fake snow and spray this on your wreath or other decorations
As with any aerosol spray do not spray towards your face or inhale the vapors
Spray in a well-ventilated area and never near an open flame
