Use a small number of versatile pieces
If you don't have the living room space to fit all the furniture you'd like use multipurpose furniture so you can quickly alter the room when entertaining guests or whenever you'd like a change
Consider a multi part sofa that can be divided into two pieces or extended to create a foot rest
Consolidate by having one object serve two purposes
Try moving the seating slightly to create a corner where one end table can serve two sofas instead of having one end table for each
Add lightweight furniture when entertaining guests
Lightweight chairs can easily be brought in when you have a large number of guests without permanently taking up space
Keeping a small couch or a couple of armchairs adds variety and comfort but if you don't rely solely on cushioned bulky furniture you'll have more space
Use furniture at roughly the same height
If some furniture is much taller than others it can make the space appear cramped and claustrophobic
Stack books onto short end tables to raise their height without needing to replace them
Let in natural light
Use lighter or more transparent curtains to make the space brighter
If you don't have windows that let in much light adding more artificial light is an acceptable compromise especially cheerier white lamps rather than yellow lighting
Add a mirror or two to the room
Sometimes the illusion of space is plenty to give a room an airy feeling
This is especially useful during times of low sunlight or when your living room has inadequate windows
Replace some furniture with glass or less full-bodied pieces
Glass topped tables glass doors or open doorways make a room more spacious
Furniture with thinner bodies on raised legs reveal more space to the eye
Use less intense neutral colors
Soft colors such as a cool blue or neutral beige make the space feel warmer and airier
Avoid dark or intense shades
Cushions drop cloths and decorative objects can be more easily and cheaply replaced than furniture or walls so begin by adjusting these
