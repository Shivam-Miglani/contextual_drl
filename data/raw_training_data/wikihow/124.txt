Wait to lay down new turf until fall or spring if possible
Fall and spring are the best seasons for turf to root into the ground because of all the rain
Winter can be too cold and summer can be too dry for turf to root
If you wish to put down turf in the summer or your area does not get enough rainfall in fall and spring install a watering system or use a hose and sprinkler to make sure your turf gets enough water
If you are installing turf in the fall lay it down early enough so that it is well established and rooted at least 6 weeks before the first hard freeze of winter
Remove any existing grass or turf from the lawn
Pull up any weeds or stones you come across
Use a spade or shovel to make clearing out the old lawn easier
If the lawn has a lot of weeds spray it with a weed killer and wait about 48 hours for the weeds to die so they’re easier to remove
Test your soil pH and adjust if necessary
Buy a soil testing kit from your garden center or nursery and test a few samples from different parts of your yard
Test your soil a few months in advance of when you plan to lay down the turf because it may take some time for any necessary amendments to take effect
Most turfgrass species prefer a soil pH between 60 and 72
If your soil is too acidic (low pH) add some ground limestone to the soil
Garden lime can be bought in most garden supply stores
If your soil is too alkaline (high pH) add garden sulfur or some type of acidic mulch such as pine needles
Some soil testing kits also allow you to check your soil’s nutrient levels
Level the lawn if it’s uneven using topsoil
Pour the topsoil over the lawn and distribute it evenly using a rake
Make sure you fill in holes and break up any mounds of dirt on the lawn
Topsoil is a surface soil that is high in nutrients
You can find bags of topsoil at your local garden center
Pack down the top layer of soil using your feet
Walk across the lawn slowly and apply pressure with your feet making sure every inch of the surface is packed
Rake across the surface of the soil again
To pack soil down more efficiently rent or buy a water-weighted lawn roller from a garden center or home improvement store
Many models can be either pushed by hand or towed behind a tractor
Adding turf will raise the level of your lawn by about 2 inches (5 cm) so pack your existing soil or turf down by at least that much
Rake a granular fertilizer over the surface of the soil
A granular fertilizer is just a non-liquid fertilizer
Use a “starter” fertilizer such as NPK 5-10-5 or similar
