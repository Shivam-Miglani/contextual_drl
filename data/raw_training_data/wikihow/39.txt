Pull over if you’re driving to treat spills safely
Make sure you are pulled over to a safe side of the road a parking lot or your final destination before treating a spill that has occurred
Never try to deal with a stain while driving
Note that while it’s easiest to treat stains as soon as possible by no means do you need to risk safety to address the spill while driving
It can wait till you reach your destination
Soak up excess liquid with a cloth
Use a paper towel a napkin or any spare fabric or rag you have on hand in the car to clean the spill when it is safe to do so
Gently blot the coffee spill to absorb as much of the moisture from the car seat fabric as you can
Don’t rub at the stain with your napkin or cloth as this can spread the stain further
Simply press with the cloth into the seat and lift straight up to absorb the moisture
Repeat blotting with new napkins or cloths if you have them and the material becomes saturated
Do this until you have as much of the liquid absorbed as possible
Brush off any solid material
Remove any coffee grounds that may have been present in your spilled coffee
It’s important to remove grounds so they don’t get stuck in crevices or cause further stains
Be sure to wait till after you’ve blotted the liquid of the stain up to remove any solids
Then you can simply brush them away into your hand or a napkin to dispose
If coffee grounds have made their way into fabric creases already and are difficult to remove do your best to blot and brush at them then wait till you have access to a vacuum with a thin hose attachment to suck them up
Apply cool water to the stain
Put cool water on the coffee spill as soon as you can after blotting it initially
Continue blotting with a clean cloth or paper towel to pull out more of the coffee from the fabric
Blot the water with a dry cloth or paper towel again to remove the moisture
Add dish soap or baking soda if you can
If you have access to either dishwashing liquid or baking soda use this to quickly treat a stain
Add a very small amount with cool water directly to the stain or to a cloth or napkin
Blot gently with your napkin or rag until the baking soda makes a paste or the dish soap makes a gentle lather on the surface of the stain
Leave baking soda on the stain for up to 30 minutes if you can to allow it to work into the stain
Use a new cloth or paper towel with just cool water to rinse the car seat fabric of the soap or baking soda
Continue to use just gentle blotting motions
