Give Chinese hibiscus lots of light
A southern window or sunroom location is the best choice
Keep Chinese hibiscus warm
These plants require temperatures between 55º to 85ºF (127 to 294ºC)
Plant Chinese hibiscus in a lightweight potting soil not garden soil
Re-pot Chinese hibiscus each spring in new potting soil
Use a bigger pot if the plant appears root bound
Keep the soil in the pot moist at all times but never let the pot sit in water or become too soggy
Use distilled water or rainwater at room temperature
Add water to the pot until water flows from the bottom
Empty saucers beneath the plant as soon as the water stops draining out
Touch the top of the potting soil to know if the plant needs water
Don’t rely on a schedule to water water when the soil feels dry to the touch
Keep humidity around the plant high
50-60 % relative room humidity is ideal
Keep Chinese hibiscus out of drafts from opening doors leaky windows or forced air vents
Fertilize Chinese hibiscus regularly all year round
Use a flowering plant water-soluble fertilizer mixed according to directions for indoor plants once a month
Or use a granular slow release fertilizer for flowering houseplants as the label directs
Wait to begin fertilization for 3 months if the potting soil you use has fertilizer included
Prune hibiscus to keep it from getting too large and to encourage fullness
Tip each tall upright branch when you re-pot in spring to encourage side growth and fullness
Using bypass garden pruning shears cut each branch back to the second leaf node from the tip
Cut just before the node
You can prune back to just before any leaf node to reduce the height or width of the hibiscus
Make sure to leave 2 to 3 leaf nodes on each stem or remove the stem completely
Groom your hibiscus
Remove dead blooms promptly
Remove yellowed or dead leaves
Dust the leaves if they appear dusty
Prune dead branches
Examine your hibiscus regularly for pests
Look for curled or wrinkled leaves
Look for lots of yellow browning spotted or falling leaves
Look for insects on and under leaves
Look for fine webbing on leaves and stems
Treat insects with a houseplant insecticide if pests are suspected
