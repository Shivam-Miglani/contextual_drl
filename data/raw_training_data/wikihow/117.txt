Arrange the individual slats or lattice over the frame of the screen
Once again the exact size number and dimension of the slats is largely up to you
Measure the total area of the frame’s inner edge and divide that number by the average width of the slats so that you’ll have an idea of how they should be spaced
Be sure you’ve purchased enough materials to provide slats for each section of the screen
Fasten the slats or lattice to the larger frame
Rest the cut 1”x4” (19x89mm) boards across the frame laterally then nail them into place
For lattice screens place the precut lattice over the frame on what will be the reverse side and fasten the edges using nails or staples
Now all that’s left to do is fit the separate sections together
Nail the top and bottom corners of each slat to make sure they'll hold
You won't need to fasten every strip of a lattice individually
Instead work your way down the strips nailing or stapling every third or fourth one
Connect the edges of the screen
Line up the frame sections in the correct orientation
On a basic two-paneled screen the sections should form a right angle
If you’re constructing an enclosure from three or more sections arrange them to make a “U” shape or square
Secure the edges using nails or wood screws
Use a clamp or a dab of wood glue to hold the pieces of the frame together while you prepare to fasten them
Fasten the frame at the top bottom and along the middle for increased stability
Add a door or hinges
Take things a step further by installing a few extra pieces of hardware
After installing a door your trash receptacle will be completely invisible to nearby onlookers
Jointed frame sections will allow you to adjust the position of the screen as you please which may come in handy for beautifying areas that are oddly shaped or change frequently
Offset your hinges roughly 6-10 inches (approximately 15-25 centimeters) from the top and bottom of the door or jointed panel
Larger areas can create an opportunity to include more elaborate features such as a swinging gate
Ornament the door of your privacy screen with a stylish set of knobs handles or pulls
Position the screen to conceal your garbage can area
Set up the finished screen and enjoy the newfound curb appeal it offers
Make sure you’re able to slide your receptacle in and out of the screen with ease
Now you’ll never again have to deal with seeing piled up rubbish laying out in the open
L-shaped screens can act as an extension of your home to hide unsightly trash from your neighbors
