Choose an area with full sunlight
Full sunlight in gardening terms means at least 6 hours of sun but in some cases plants requiring full sunlight might need 8 or even 10 hours of light to thrive
For raspberries aim to expose them to as much light as possible
Warm sunshine has a tendency to improve the quality of raspberry fruit making it juicier and more flavorful
Fruit with poor light might turn out stunted and shriveled
You may have to move garden or yard items that block the sun to your raspberries
Prune back trees or bushes that could block the sun
Avoid windy areas
Although environmentally hardy raspberry plants are susceptible to wind damage
Plant your raspberry plants near a fence or on the side of a structure to block the wind
Set up a wind block for plants by stringing a sheet or tarp between posts
Provide additional support for your berries by stringing two guidelines between two row-end T-trellises or V-trellises
Each line should be separated by 3½ ft (11 m) to create a space for the berries to grow and should be about 3½ ft high
Plan for adequate spacing
You'll be planting your raspberries in rows
Plan for within a row red and yellow varieties being separated by a distance of about 2 ft (61 m)
Black and purple varieties should be kept 3 ft (91 m) from other same-row plants
Distance between rows should be between 6 and 24 in (152 and 61 cm)
Spacing your plants adequately will help them receive the most sunlight possible which will encourage the best possible harvest
Ensure that the soil is well drained and disease free
Rich well-draining sandy loam soil will provide the best growing conditions for your raspberries
Improve your soil quality by using plant formulated soil and mixing in compost with it
Although raspberries fare poorly in standing water or when overwatered make sure water is easily available
Water supply is especially important during dry times of the season
Refrain from planting raspberries in soil previously used for bramble berries tomatoes potatoes peppers eggplants or roses
These can leave behind diseases
Destroy any wild growing raspberries or blackberries within about 600 ft (183 m) of those you plant
Wild berries can also transmit diseases to your healthy berries
Check the pH of the soil
Most berries do best in slightly acidic soil and raspberries flourish with a pH rating between 56 and 62
You can purchase pH testing kits at your local nursery or home center but you might also check out other methods as well
You should be able to find soil pH testing forms bags and instructions at your local agricultural extension office as well
In most cases you can easily lower the pH level of your soil by mixing granular sulfur with it
This is available at most nurseries and home centers
