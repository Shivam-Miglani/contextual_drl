Talk to your neighbors
People who live nearby may have noticed something or may have additional information about other burglaries in the area
If any of your neighbors have surveillance cameras they may have captured the break-in or related activity on video
If you talk to anyone who has any additional information – for example your neighbor describes a van parked in front of your home around the time of the burglary – make sure you call the police and update your report as well
Check your bank accounts or credit card statements
If any of your cards were stolen in the burglary unauthorized charges can lead to clues that could help identify the burglar
You should report stolen cards to your bank or credit card company right away to limit your liability for any unauthorized charges but there's a chance the card may have already been used
If the card has been used at a location that has a security camera you may be able to use the information from your statement regarding when the card was swiped to obtain video footage of the burglar
If you get any information about the suspects this way make sure you provide the information to the police as soon as possible so they can be apprehended
Although police may need more evidence tying them to the burglary before they have probable cause to charge them with that crime they may be able to identify them or charge them with a lesser offense in the meantime
Call local pawn shops
The burglar may try to sell the stolen property at pawn shops in the area
If something rare or distinctive was stolen it's much more likely that you'll be able to find it than if it's a common item and you have no record of its serial number
Although pawn shops typically are required to check databases for stolen items providing store owners or employees with a description of your items can help ensure they're keeping an eye out for them
Activate any trackers in electronic devices
If your phone or computer were among the items stolen you may be able to locate them using built-in tracking technology that can find the device using GPS
These trackers can help locate your device or even the perpetrator of the burglary
However let the police know if you've searched for your electronics in this way
It's safest for you if the police follow the lead rather than if you go by yourself to retrieve your device
Consider using social media
Posting information about the burglary can lead to additional information and potential leads in your case
Encourage everyone who follows your accounts to share your post even if they don't have any additional information for you
Particularly if you have any video or pictures of the suspect or the suspect's car someone may be able to identify him or her – especially if you live in a relatively small town or rural area
