Set a trap
Make sure that it is legal to exterminate or relocate voles as it is prohibited in some states
Set your traps when voles are at their peak reproduction
Choose from a variety of lethal traps depending on your budget
Set your trap so that they are perpendicular to the runways of the vole or near the entrances of tunnels
Check your traps daily and remove dead and captured voles
Mouse snap traps are the cheapest traps that you can employ
Set your traps in late fall or early spring when voles are at their peak reproduction
Employ either one-time traps or reusable ones if you’re comfortable dealing the the dead mole carcass
Don’t leave dead pests as other voles or pests may feed on them
They may also attract more dangerous animals
Protect children and pets from your traps by covering your traps in a box
This will also help disguise your trap from the voles
If you do not see any activity for a few days switch locations of your traps to other tunnels or runways
Use apple bits oatmeal or peanut butter as effective bait to lure the voles to your traps
Set a trap for live capture
If it is illegal to kill voles in your location you can remove them using humane traps
The Havahart or the SNG model of the Sherman traps will capture your voles alive
Remember that you need to relocate the animals once caught with these traps so choose a location away from other homes and at least a minimum of half a mile away from you own
Humane traps are difficult to use if you have a large population of voles as the cost and labour will rise
You will need a minimum of 12 - 50 traps depending on how large your garden
Choose the right poison
Note that while poison may be the most effective it may also be the most dangerous to your own health
Poison can harm children pets and even be washed into your water supply
Use poison in the early fall or late winter because the voles with be less finicky with their diet with a scarcity of food
Always obey the safety precautions after you have read the label
The safest and most effective poison baits are Warfarin-based like Rodex Kaput Mouse Blocks or D-Con which can be purchased at your local hardware store
Warfarin acts slowly as it prevents blood from clotting
As such voles will feel its full effect after about 5 days so rotate your traps every week or set 2 traps every few days
Follow the safety precautions so that the poison doesn’t spread to other animals
Utilize bait containers or place the trap directly at the opening of a vole tunnel
You may also create an open-ended box for your traps
Always handle voles -- dead or alive -- with gloves
They may carry disease organisms associated with the plague and tularemia
