Handle books hygienically
Handling your books hygienically will help ensure minimal wear and tear accidental spills or permanent stains
Wash your hands before handling any book and avoid having any liquids or foods nearby during handling or reading to help keep your book in an ideal condition
Avoid using saliva to turn pages and instead use a sponge Use cotton gloves if you are handling a rare old or fragile book
Remove large or bulky bookmarks
Large bookmarks can stress both the binding or glue in the spine of the book as well as make impressions and indentations in the page
Remove bulky bookmarks to reduce the chance of pages being accidentally ripped torn or damaged while reading
Try using a piece of thread or silk ribbon as a bookmark to avoid any unwanted damage
If you wish to keep the bookmark with the book place the bookmark in an acid free envelope next to the book or inside an insert
Avoid folding or “dog-earing” the corners of pages as they can cause lasting damage
Avoid opening the book widely
Both paperback and hardback books are either bound with an adhesive stitching or a combination of the two
The wider you open a book the more stress you are putting the spine and binding under
Use caution when opening new hardbacks as they often have stiff spine and are prone to cracking
Turn pages carefully
Pages experience natural deterioration over time and can often become quite fragile or brittle
Use caution when turning pages in order to avoid unwanted tears wrinkles dimples and rips to pages or fragile bindings
Try to use two hands while reading
Using two hands while reading will ensure that the book's binding and pages are not being unnecessarily stressed
If holding a book with two hands is uncomfortable due to fragility size or weight lay the book on a table or cradle it in your lap
Don’t bend paperback covers while reading
It can be difficult to get them to resume their original shape and it often causes spine damage
Invest in reading copies if you have a book you can’t put down and want to preserve
Send rare and fragile books to a specialist in book conservation
Whether you have a rare first edition or a paperback with sentimental value sending a damaged book to a specialist is your best chance at repair
Book conservationists can have many specializations from historic preservation to binding and material repair
Consult national book conservation organizations like the Regional Alliance for Preservation (RAP) or the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) to find out which local conservationists can provide you with a consultation
