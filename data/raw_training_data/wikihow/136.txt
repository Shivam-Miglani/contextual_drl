Make a self-watering planter
Take a two-liter bottle and poke small holes in the upper half
Then cut the bottle in half making sure all the holes are in the upper portion of the bottle
Poke a hole in the bottle top and thread a piece of felt or cotton fabric through the bottle top
Finish the self-watering planter
Turn the top of the bottle upside down and place it in the bottom of the bottle
The fabric should be long enough to touch the bottom of the bottle and long enough to have some sticking up into the top
Add enough water to the bottom of the bottle for the fabric to get plenty wet
Fill the top with soil making sure the fabric is in the soil
This will help set up the self-watering plant
Create hanging baskets
You can make small or large hanging baskets from bottles depending on the size of bottles or jugs you use
Start by removing the slanted top of the bottle or the part of the bottle with the handle
The hanger should be uniform and smooth all around with no handles or sloping
Finish the hanging basket
Use something sharp to make holes in three to four places equidistant apart around the top edge of the planter
Using string or yarn pull the yarn through the holes
Make sure to make a knot on the inside so the yarn or string doesn’t slip through
When you finish the yarn or string should be secure enough that the hanger doesn’t fall
Tie the yarn or string together at the top
Place on a hook
You can paint the bottle before planting it to add a creative touch
Make a plant container
Turn a two liter or 20 ounce bottle sideways
Cut the bottle in half
Use both halves to make two planters
Cut small drainage holes into the bottom
Fill with soil and plant flowers or herbs inside
You can paint the outside of the planters to decorate your garden
