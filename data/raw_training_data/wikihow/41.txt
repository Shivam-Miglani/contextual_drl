Keep away from fire and heat
When your parents are cooking or lighting a fire keep away from the area
You can still talk to them across the room or from several steps away but there is no need to be standing next to the heat
Keep a good distance from any fire that is burning and never place objects in a fire
Do not play with matches or lighters
These are not toys
They are for creating a flame to light a fire and you can easily hurt yourself
Take them to your parents if you find them
Keep safe in the kitchen
Never reach up for a handle on a stove or table
The pot may be filled with boiling water or very hot food and if it falls on your skin or face you can be very badly burnt
Always ask if you are curious and want to look inside a cooking pot
Ask your parents to turn the handles of cooking pots towards the centre of the stove
Always get adult help to cook anything
Never put anything on a lamp or near burning candles
The lamp can overheat and anything put near a candle might catch on fire from the flame
Don't pick up things that have been sitting in or fallen into a fire
The coals are very very hot and the flames can burn you
If something falls into a fire ask an adult for help straight away
Look out for your little brothers and sisters and any other young children
Make sure that they don't go near the stove or a fire source
Teach them about how fire or heat can hurt them
Ask your parents to buy you close-fitting nightwear
Loose nightwear can easily trail into a fire or heater and catch on fire
Close-fitting pajamas are safer
Be electricity wise
Never stick your fingers sticks or any other objects into an electrical socket
This can burn you very badly if the electricity carries out to your body
Leave electrical cords alone
They can be a cause of fire
Practice a safety drill
If it ever happened that your clothes caught on fire it is important to practice this so that you will do it automatically Stop - stop screaming crying and panicking Drop - drop to the floor straight away Roll - roll over and over to try to put out the flames
Know what to do if you are caught in a fire
If you are asleep or inside your house when a fire starts there may already be thick dark smoke when you try to get out
Get down low and crawl to get out
There is usually less smoke at the floor level
