Decide how large you want to make your Zen garden
Assess your available space
Are you going to make a garden that fills up part of your backyard or are you going to start with a Zen garden to place on your desk
The steps are the same the scale will just be different
Create a mold to contain the sand andor gravel
Sand or gravel generally form the matrix of a Zen garden and to keep it looking sharp you need the matrix to be contained
If you are making a large garden consider using 2" x 4" pieces of lumber old railroad ties or any other type of wood
If you are making a desktop Zen garden simply gather and cut enough wood to make a small container
Nail screw or glue together your form
After you have completed your form you can decorate the wood by painting staining or varnishing it
Place a weed retainer such as black plastic down prior to setting your Zen garden mold
Zen gardens receive much of their appeal from their cleanliness
Keeping out weeds is a must for outdoor gardens
Fill the form to the top with sand or gravel
Spread the sand or gravel evenly and as level as possible
For a small desktop garden you might be able to buy sand in small bags at a local pet shop or aquarium supply store
For larger gardens call the local rock shop quarry or landscaping supply company
This is only needed in an outdoor garden
Put selected features in your Zen garden to set a visually stimulating theme
Consider using old mossy logs rocks with interesting colors shapes or textures or other items
Place them off-center and partially submerged for the best effect
Zen gardens generally include natural items made of wood rock and vegetation but don’t be afraid to add statues or other additions
Just don’t clutter your Zen garden
Remember you want it to be peaceful and simple
Make sure that the feng shui is in check with your karma an dharma before enjoying your zen garden
If it is not balanced properly there could be some major problems and could possibly send your karma into a yin yang whirlwind (which is NOT good!) * See feng shui and karma for details
Rake the sand or gravel in long curving strokes to represent water ripples
You can use a number of patterns to accentuate your garden
The nice thing is that you can change it as many times as you like
