Choose or clean out a childâ€™s sand box
You can either purchase a new plastic sandbox (preferably one that is BPA free) or use an old one that your child no longer uses
If you use an old one make sure to remove all of the sand and other debris from it and clean it out well such as by spraying it with a hose
Drill holes into the bottom of the sandbox
It is important to make holes in the sandbox to provide good drainage
Turn the sandbox upside down and use a drill to make several holes evenly spaced around the bottom of the sandbox
Place the sandbox on a bed of gravel or stones
To improve the drainage of your sandbox you may also want to place some gravel or stones down where you plan to keep the garden
This will help to prevent water from collecting in the bottom of the box which will lead to rot
Line the box with landscaping liner or fabric
By placing some landscape liner or fabric in the bottom of the box you will decrease the amount of weeds that show up in your sandbox garden
Lay down a layer of landscape liner or fabric that is large enough to cover the bottom of the box
Place 2 inches (51 cm) to 3 inches (76 cm) of stones or gravel on the liner
Before you add any soil to the sandbox make sure to line the bottom of the box with 2 inches (51 cm) to 3 inches (76 cm) of stones or gravel
This will help to ensure that the soil has good drainage
Add the soil
To complete your sandbox garden bed fill up the sandbox the rest of the way with soil
Make sure to use good soil that is well-suited to growing plants in a container
Plant your plants
Choose plants and seeds that thrive in containers
You can grow vegetables herbs flowers or other types of plants in your sandbox garden
Just make sure that they are types that will thrive in a container
