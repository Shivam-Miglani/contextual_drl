Set up your rain barrel in the right spot
You will usually be placing your barrel under or attached to one of your existing downspouts
However you need to ensure that the rain barrel uses a diverter or has an overflow to get rid of water pooling at your home's foundation
If it's possible extend the downspout piping to a location for the barrel that is a few feet away from the house to avoid overflow saturating the foundation
A full rain barrel can weigh more than 400 pounds so make sure you don't place it on anything that can't take this weight or where it might do damage if knocked over
Keep the barrel as low as possible for more stability placing it on a wide solid base
Secure ratchet strap(s) around the barrel and anchor them firmly to either the house or two ground anchors placing the straps in an 'X'
Tightly pull the straps downward to add stability
Posts could also be placed into the ground to serve as a backstop and anchor for the barrel
Determine how large the barrel should be
This will depend on the size of your property but the standard size is 55 gallons (2082 L)
Choose the right material
You can use plastic rubber or even wood
Metal can be used but is often not recommended
Just make sure your material is sealed and treated to hold water for a long time without leaking rusting rotting or decaying chemicals into the water
Look for food grade barrels that are sold new or even used from restaurants food distribution centers commercial food processing plants and similar businesses
There are 3 types of plastics that are very harmful to humans and should be avoided
You can identify them by their recycling number
The numbers to look for include #3 Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) #6 Polystyrene (PS) and #7 Polycarbonate
Clean the inside of the barrel
This may not be a big deal if your barrel is new but make sure you remove any debris that may be left inside
Start by washing it well with warm water and dish soap scrubbing the sides if needed
Dump the soapy water and rinse it well
Then sanitize the barrel using unscented household bleach diluted with water
Mix 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of bleach into 1 quart (94 liter) of water or 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of bleach into 1 gallon (38 liter) of water
Know what to expect
A rain barrel is just a barrel with a hole in the top or side allowing water to enter from the downspout
It can have a filter or closed system to keep out debris and mosquitoes
It always has a spigot andor drain valve near the bottom to connect a hose to or fill a bucket from
The rain barrel should also have a way to control overflow with proper drainage so it doesn't saturate the ground near the barrel or seep into the house's or building's foundation
