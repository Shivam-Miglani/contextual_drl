Choose a thick towel
Towel thickness is measured in grams per square meter (GSM)
A thin towel is about 300-400 GSM and might be acceptable for the gym or kitchen but not for the bath
A low-weight bath towel is between 400-600 GSM
Heavier and more absorbent bath towels are 600-900 GSM
Heavy towels can absorb more liquid than thinner towels
Unfortunately these thicker towels take longer to dry
Appropriately thick towels are likely made of high-quality cotton varieties like Pima or Egypt cotton
Terrycloth towels are the most absorbent variety
They are constructed with extra yarn and larger thread loops to maximize absorbency
Select a soft towel
Towels that are soft will not chafe or irritate your skin
People with sensitive skin might enjoy soft towels
It can be hard to tell which towels will remain soft over the long term
After they’re washed towels tend to lose their softness
However towels made of rayon tend to be quite soft
Towels of high-quality Pima or Egypt cotton are also very soft
Turkish cotton is also exceptionally soft
You might be able to increase the softness of your towels with fabric softener but they will become more flammable and less absorbent
The softest towels are often made with long-staple or extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton
Turkish Pima and Egyptian cottons tend to be ELS or long-staple cottons as are Supima or MicroCotton fabrics
Pick a durable towel
Invest in towels that will not easily shred in the washer or due to use
The most durable towels are two-ply rather than one-ply
Cotton towels or towels made of a cottonpolyester hybrid thread are more durable than those of rayon
However cottonpolyester towels are less absorbent than those of pure cotton
A durable towel should last about 10 years or more
Towels using long-staple or extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton are stronger than those of regular cotton
Most towels made with Turkish Egyptian Pima Supima or MicroCotton are ELS or long-staple cotton
Towels of combed cotton are composed of cotton which is combed before use to remove shorter threads and other undesirable bits
Choose a towel made of ringspun cotton
Ringspun cotton is one of the most durable types of cotton
It combines long and short fibers to create finer threads
Go for a terrycloth towel if you want a durable towel
Terrycloth towels might be made of linen or cotton and can be woven or knitted
Their larger thread loops and extra yarn make them especially durable
Choose a Terrycloth towel if you value durability in your towels and don’t mind long drying times
