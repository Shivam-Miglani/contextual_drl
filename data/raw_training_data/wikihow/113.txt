Consult your manufacturer’s guide or contractor
If you installed your countertops yourself then keep a photo of the concrete mix and surface coating so that you can consult it for reference
If you had a contractor install everything then they more than likely gave you instructions post-installation
If not go ahead and call them prior to your first cleaning with any immediate questions
Be aware that cleaning your countertops with solutions or methods outside of the approved ones may result in your warranty being voided
Use pH wipes
These are wipes that are sold in hardware and sometimes grocery stores
They come pre-moistened and are designed to be gentle on natural stone surfaces
One benefit of these wipes is that they are so gentle that you can use them to wipe down your countertops on an everyday basis without sustaining any damage
They may also be sold under the label “pH-neutral wipes” or just “stone countertop wipes”
Scrub with a dish soap solution
In a bowl or bucket mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of mild dishwashing liquid into warm water
You can then dip a soft cloth or sponge into this mixture and use it to wipe down your countertops
Wring it out so that the cloth or sponge is damp not soaking wet before wiping
This is a mild method that can work for both sealed and unsealed types of concrete countertops
This is a great way to clean prior to putting on a new coat of sealant
Be very careful using heavily textured scrubbing pads as they may leave scratches and marks behind
Polish in small circles
As you wipe down or polish your countertop keep your movements smooth and even
Rub in a circular motion applying firm but not overly hard pressure
As you remove stains rewet your cloth or sponge and continue scrubbing gently
Do a final water rinse
When you’ve finished with a general wipe down and you’ve removed all set-in stains then get a fresh cloth
Dip this cloth in water and rub down the countertop once more
You are trying to remove any sediment or residue left behind by the cleaner
Let it air dry
After your water wash-down let the countertops dry naturally
If you want to speed the process along you can wipe them down with a microfiber cloth just be careful not to leave dust or fibers behind
You’ll want the countertop dry before you try to apply wax or sealer
