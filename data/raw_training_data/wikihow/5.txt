Secure your pets in carriers
As soon as a tornado warning is announced or you spot a potential twister spring into action immediately
Command or coax your cat into its designated carrier or if necessary use a towel or pillowcase to scoop it up and place it down into the carrier (with its opening facing up)
Lead or command your dog into its carrier in the storm shelter or other safe zone
Place some familiar comforts like toys or blankets in each carrier
A sturdy pet carrier or crate provides your pet with added protection and keeps them from running away or hiding in fear
Provide further protection from debris
No matter how sturdy your storm shelter happens to be your should cover yourself and your pets with padding to reduce the risk of injury due to falling or flying debris
Place heavy blankets over the pet carriers or even use an old mattress kept in the safe zone to huddle beneath
When you run your regular tornado drills include this element as well
It will likely be disorienting and perhaps even frightening for your pets
Try to remain — or at least appear — calm
No matter how often you train for it experiencing a real tornado is a terrifying experience for all involved
As this loud powerful storm barrels through do your best to present an even keel for the sake of all the humans and pets in the storm shelter
Trust in your planning and preparation to see you through as the outcome is by this point largely out of your hands — the storm is now in control
Don’t leave your pets behind if at all possible
After the storm passes you may have no choice but to temporarily evacuate due to damage or contamination
Bring your pets with you in their carriers and with their supplies unless you absolutely cannot do so
Don’t assume you’ll be able to get right back to them within a few hours or a day to care for them at whatever is left of your home
Of course only you can decide how much personal risk you are willing to take before during or after a storm to protect your pets
Proper planning will help reduce these risks regardless
Keep an eye out for post-storm dangers
When you emerge from your safe zone it may be difficult to recognize your home and the surrounding area
Tornadoes can cause catastrophic damage that leaves both humans and pets stunned and disoriented
Such disorientation will cause additional fear and anxiety in your pets which may in turn lead to unusual or reckless behavior
Keep your pets in their carriers or leashed in the aftermath of the storm they may get frightened and try to run away or hide
Watch for broken glass protruding nails or sharp debris unstable walls floors or entire structures gas leaks and downed power lines
Take note that puddles or pools of water may be contaminated
