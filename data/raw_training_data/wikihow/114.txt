Prepare a diluted bleach solution in a bathtub
An easy and effective way to clean your rubber bathmat is to soak it in a diluted bleach solution in your bathtub
If you have a deep or utility sink that may be preferable
Be prepared to measure the amount of bleach to be used in making your solution and have more than enough room for a proper soaking
Use protective gear when handling bleach
Bleach may splash when being poured and can irritate your eyes or skin
Wear protective cleaning gloves before pouring bleach
You may also wish to use goggles to cover your eyes
Make sure the bathroom area is well-ventilated
Before preparing a diluted bleach solution open a window or leave the bathroom door open
Fumes from using bleach or making a bleach solution can be noxious and cause dizziness
Add only cold water to the bathtub first
Add one gallon of water to the bathtub
Do not pour bleach directly into the bathtub
Do not make a diluted bleach solution with hot water
Hot water may intensify fumes as bleach is added
Measure the amount of bleach to be used
Have a measuring cup or tablespoon handy
Do not pour bleach indiscriminately into the cold water
Unequal parts of bleach to water may create a more potent and dangerous solution and cause dizziness or breathing problems
Some recommended measurements are as follows Add 1 teaspoon (49ml) chlorine bleach to 1 gallon (38L) water for normal cleaning
Add 1 cup (240ml) of chlorine bleach to 5 gallons (189L) of water for heavier cleaning
Clean thoroughly or quickly
You may decide a more thorough cleaning is in order or you might just want to keep your bathmats fresh
To eliminate mold or mildew leave the rubber bathmat in the diluted bleach solution for a few (3-4) hours
To freshen up the bathmat with a quick clean scrub the rubber bathmat with a cleaning brush or scouring pad to remove dirt and debris after soaking for a few minutes
Dry bathmat when done cleaning
Remove the bathmat from the bathtub and set to dry on the back of a chair or outdoors in the sun
Drain and rinse the bathtub to remove dirt and scum collected from the cleaning
