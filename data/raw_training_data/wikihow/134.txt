Purchase lilies with healthy crowns and leaves
You can find water lilies at your local nursery or garden center or you could ask a friend with lilies for clippings
Look for plants with healthy crowns or the part where the stems meet the roots
Check for stems that easily pull away from the crown and look for yellow curling or damaged leaves
An unhealthy crown and yellow leaves are signs of crown rot
It’s an incurable fungal infection and is one of the only health issues that affect water lilies
Fill 34 of a pot or mesh basket with aquatic soil and fertilizer
Line your pot or aquatic basket with a coarse fabric such as hessian or burlap
Use a soil labelled for aquatic use as standard potting soil is too fluffy and will float away when submerged
Add soil to the container until it’s 34 full then add aquatic fertilizer
The right amount of fertilizer depends on your product so read the instructions for the fertilizer you purchase
A typical ratio is 10 grams (about 13 oz) of fertilizer for 1 gallon (38 L) of soil
Remove the lily from its old container and trim it
Gently pull the lily out of the old container and rinse away excess soil from its rhizome or root system
Trim any old fleshy roots with pruning shears but leave white hair-like roots intact
Place the root ball in the soil at a 45 degree angle
Set the lily's root ball or rhizome on top of the soil on the side of the container
Make sure the crown or the part with the stems emerge points at a 45 degree angle toward the center of the pot
If your lily hasn’t matured and has a growing tip instead of stems position the growing tip at the same level as the top of the soil
Add more soil and a top layer of gravel
Add more soil but don’t completely fill the container
Leave about 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 cm) between the top of the soil and container’s rim
Lightly press the soil to pack it then add a layer of gravel to help keep the soil from floating away
Make sure you don’t pack the gravel tightly around the stems
If your lily isn’t mature leave a space in the gravel for the plant’s growing tip which should be level with the top of the soil
Water it well then submerge the container in water
Soak the pot completely with a hose then lower it into your pond or aquatic planter
For the first few weeks submerge the pot so that 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) of water covers the crown and young leaves float on the water’s surface
If necessary stack bricks or other supports to keep the pot at the right height
Keeping the pot at a shallow height will encourage growth
