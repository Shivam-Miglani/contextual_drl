Summer's great but if you don't have an AC unit in your work/home office good luck trying to get any work done
What to do
Why not have your computer work for YOU to keep you cool
Use your driver to remove the stand from the fan so that it sits inside your containers without any obstruction
You're going to use your styrofoam containers to create a double-walled inner container where your ice will be stored
To start use your utility knife to cut out the bottom of one of the containers then place that container inside the other
Cutting out the bottom will give you more room for ice
If using a hole saw you'll get a cleaner cut through your styrofoam containers if you stabilize the area to be cut with masking tape
If not using a hole saw see the tip box at the end of this step
Apply tape to the inside and outside of the styrofoam walls where you will cut through
