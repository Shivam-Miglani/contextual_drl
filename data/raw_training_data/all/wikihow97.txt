Decide how you want the room to feel
What kind of mood do you want your room to convey
Colors can create a sense of calm or rev up your mood
Decide if you want to feel soothed when you spend time in your room or if you want to feel peppy and full of energy
Look through decorating magazines and websites
Create a file with images you like and use these as a guide to help you decide what you want to do
Look for images of rooms that have an overall feel that you like
Save images that have elements or details that appeal to you
Make notes to yourself about why you like a particular room or look
You may forget if you collect a lot of images
Pin up print images in your room and visualize how different looks would work in your space
Select a color scheme
Color family and tone are important factors in how a room will look and feel
Colors will also range from light to medium to dark
Accent colors or trim colors should have the same tone as the wall and ceiling but you can use color intensity or color families that complement each other to create contrast
Color tone is either warm cool or neutral
Warm tones can create a cozy feel while cool tones can make a room feel bigger
Choosing coordinating colors of the same intensity can make a room feel more spacious
Large rooms can look very dramatic and dynamic if there are sharp contrasts between the intensity of the trim and the wall color
Pick a color family to create feeling
Different color families affect how people feel some colors are warmer and others cooler and these qualities are important for conveying a mood
Reds are hot or warm colors typically
Red is also a very hot color in terms of creating a feeling in a room
Red can feel romantic and dramatic or lively and exciting
Blue is a cool color and conveys a sense of calm and peace
Like the perfect clear light blue of a summer sky or the deep blue of the ocean the soothing quality of blues wonâ€™t vary much with intensity
Try green colors for a good balance between warm and cool
Because green is the result of a warm color (yellow) and a cool color (blue) it is an excellent choice for rooms with a neutral feel
Yellow is an energy color as well as a comforting hue
Yellow is a great choice for rooms that could use some brightening up while still feeling soft and tranquil
Neutrals like beiges or whites will almost always have a hint of color and tone
If you want a very quiet space these are a good choice and you can introduce a suggestion of warmth or coolness by choosing a neutral with warm or cool colored tints
