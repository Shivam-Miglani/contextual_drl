Washing soda is a chemical compound that can be used to remove stubborn stains from laundry
It's commonly used in homemade laundry detergents and dish detergents and is known for its stain-lifting abilities
Washing soda can be bought at most big box stores in the United States but isn't widely available around the rest of the world
The good news is that you can make your own washing soda using one ingredient and it is extremely inexpensive
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit
Pour your desired amount of baking soda into a baking dish
Make as much or as little as you want
Cook the baking soda in the oven for one hour making sure to stir around several times while cooking
At this point the baking soda has broken down and the water has been cooked out
You now have washing soda
Carefully remove from oven and allow to cool
Once the washing soda has cooled store it in an airtight container until you are ready to use it
