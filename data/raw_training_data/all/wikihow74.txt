Pack a one person tent
A lightweight portable tent takes up little room in your car
Setting one up is much easier and faster than building a shelter from scratch if you end up lost or caught in a storm
This is also a good solution if you may need to leave your home at a moment's notice
Keep food water and fuel in the car as well or in a handheld pack as portable as you can make it
Build a shelter from branches or debris
Even flimsy material can greatly increase your odds of survival in stormy or wintry conditions
Refer to the linked article for full instructions or follow this quick checklist Clear a patch of relatively dry ground
Insulate it with a layer of branches or dry clothing
A good rule of thumb to have is 091 metres (3 ft 0 in) or more of debris in autumn and fall and about 030–091 metres (1 ft 0 in–3 ft 0 in) of insulation in warmer weather and 061 metres (2 ft 0 in) in rainy weather
Cover this with a simple lean-to structure
If you have time and rope lean branches against together and tie them together
If not just lean branches cardboard or anything else against a tree trunk or boulder
Cover the structure with branches or other debris as well as you can for insulation (or a tarp if available)
Pine branches with the needles facing down trap additional air pockets for insulation
A top layer of leaves or trash increases rain resistance
Build a snow cave
Even a bare field of snow can provide shelter if you are able to put in a few hours' work and the snow is packed enough to form a structure
Pile up the snow into a hillock large enough to fit you leave it two hours to harden then dig out a tunnel into the interior
Pack a compact snow shovel to make this more feasible in emergency situations
If the snow is too powdery or if temperatures are too high (which could cause a collapse) dig a trench in the snow instead and cover it with a tarp
Keep shelters small if it's cold
Whichever type of shelter you use it should be just large enough to fit you
The less space there is the faster your body heat will warm it
In warm conditions you want a big shelter so it will keep you protected and cooler than a shelter that is a few centimetersinches from your face
