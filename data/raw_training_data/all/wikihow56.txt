Dampen a clean rag with white vinegar
Your rag should be wet through with white vinegar but excess vinegar should not drip or seep from the rag
Either pour vinegar onto your rag in a sink or dunk your rag in vinegar in a bucket
Wring out the rag lightly over a sink
Too much white vinegar can cause this liquid to spread to areas of the marble that are already clean
Although this can be wiped away easily wringing out your rag after wetting it can prevent extra work
Drape the wet rag on top of stains or buildup
Place the vinegar dampened rag over the buildup or stain on your cultured marble
Make sure the rag is flat against the stain and the wet parts of the rag touch it
Allow the rag to remain on top of the buildup or stain for several hours
With especially light buildup or stains you may be able to wipe these away in one swipe with your vinegar dampened rag
Rinse the treated area with cold water
Remove the vinegar dampened rag from the afflicted area of your marble
Pour cold water from your sink into a cup or small bucket
Use this to douse the treated area of your marble
Wipe up excess liquid with a clean soft dry rag
Hot water in some cases can cause stains to stick to surfaces more stubbornly
Using cold water will prevent this from happening
Treat remaining stains or buildup with a cleaning agent
Select a cleaning agent that is intended for marble or similar stone
This product should not have abrasives which can scratch or compromise the finish of your marble
Follow the label directions on the product for best results
Although proper usage will vary from product to product in many cases you can combine a product like Barkeeperâ€™s Friend with a small amount of water to make a paste
Apply this to remaining stains or buildup for a few hours
Generally by allowing your cleaning product more time to work on the stain the results will be better
However this may not be the case with all cleaners
Be sure to check the label
Rinse away the cleaning agent and polish the marble if desired
Fill your cup with cold water again
Pour it on the cleaned portion of your marble and wipe up excess liquid and remaining dirtiness with a clean soft dry rag
After this your counter should be clean
Polish the marble with a suitable polishing agent and a soft rag or polishing cloth to restore its luster
