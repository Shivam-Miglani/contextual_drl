Choose dark wood or stain
Go dark on the wood furniture you use for your bedroom
Select furniture that is made with a naturally dark wood like mahogany walnut or rosewood
Or use a dark stain on a lighter wood
You can re-stain a piece of furniture yourself by sanding it down then applying the appropriate dark wood stain
Go for a high-gloss lacquer for a very polished look for your room or stick to a rougher matte or even aged quality for more of a casual “shabby-chic” style
Look for carving and ornate details
Choose furniture with carved wood designs inlays or other details if you can
Find these qualities on older furniture from vintage or antique stores
Watch for any furniture with arched or scalloped details a popular design in Moroccan architecture and furniture
You can even affix carved wood pieces to a piece of furniture like a headboard or chest of drawers for an easy update to a plain piece of wood furniture
Get a statement piece bed frame
Use a large bed as the focal point of a Moroccan bedroom
Create an exotic oasis feeling for the room where you sleep
Try a four-poster bed with a canopy for a dreamy touch
You can also get a canopy that hangs from the ceiling to drape over the bed
Find or make a headboard for the bed that will become a statement piece for the room
Look for ornate wood carvings or inlay details or simulate a headboard simply by hanging a rich tapestry or rug on the wall at the head of the bed
Find matching nightstands and chairs
Add a couple of tables or a chair in a similar style as your bed frame to complete the room
Keep furniture minimal and low to the ground
Easily match your bed frame by staining a wood table or chair with a similar shade of stain
Update an old table that doesn’t match your theme by repainting it in a new color or pattern
If possible building in a window seat or just using a low bench thoughtfully can add to the soft and comfortable low-to-the-ground seating in the room
