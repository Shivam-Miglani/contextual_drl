Turn off all faucets in your house
If you have multiple faucets spigots or appliances running while you test the flow rate it will give you an inaccurate reading
Make sure all water-fed appliances and faucets are in the off position while you measure the water flow
Water-fed appliances include the dishwasher and laundry machine
Find a spigot or faucet on the bottom floor or basement
These locations will give you the most accurate reading because it's closest to your main water supply
Water loses pressure as it travels through pipes and the water supply is usually located in the basement or bottom floor
Place a 1 gallon (38 L) bucket under the faucet
Use a bucket that's exactly 1 gallon (38 L)
You are finding gallons or liters per minute and the size of the bucket needs to be exact
Fill the bucket and time it
Turn on the spigot or faucet and use a watch or timer and count how many seconds it takes to fill up the bucket completely
Once you get the time mark it down on a piece of paper
The main water supply can usually be found in your basement crawlspace or next to your water heater
Sometimes the main water supply will be connected to the outside of your house or located in a covered box near the sidewalk
Divide 60 by the number of seconds it took to fill up the bucket
Dividing 60 by the number of seconds it took to fill up your bucket will give you your houseâ€™s gallons (liters) per minute or GPM (LPM)
Most residential houses should maintain a flow of 6 gallons (23 L) per minute
This will allow larger appliances like a washer machine or shower to operate at a normal water pressure
For instance if it took 30 seconds to fill up the bucket you'd calculate 6030 = 2 gallons per minute
Install a water pressure regulator for pressure over 6 GPM
If your flow rate is higher than 6 GPM it may mean that your water pressure is too high
Hire a plumber or handyman to install a water pressure regulator to your main water supply to regulate the flow of water
If your water pressure is too high water may shoot out of the sides and crevices in your pipes or spigots
Call your landlord or water company for pressure lower than 6 GPM
If you have under 6 GPM it means that you may have low water pressure
Low pressure can be caused by blocked pipes leaking pipes or a water supply malfunction
A water booster can also sometimes be installed into to increase water pressure
