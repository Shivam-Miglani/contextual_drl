Decide what purpose you want your gardening journal to fulfill
This could be a more casual record of your activity or a repository of essential information
If you are a more casual gardener who merely wants to look back and see what you've done a simple diary will suffice
If you are a more serious gardener especially someone hoping to use or sell produce from your garden keeping a gardening journal will be an essential part of planning your future activity
Choose a journal format that suits your purpose
For a simple journal use a notebook or diary or even graph paper if you just want to record planting dates
For a more serious journal choose a large binder to which you can add paper and pouches for seeds
Electronic formats are also an option
For a diary-like journal on a computer use a word processing program and create a new page or file for each entry
For a journal with measurements or statistics use a data organization program like Microsoft Excel
There are also apps available for smartphones such as Garden Pro and Master Gardener
Divide your garden journal into sections
These may be chronological topical or practical
You may choose to have a section for each growing season or to divide your journal into plant types
Additionally you might have different sections for seed notes weather notes and financial data
In all cases you can use each section either as a diary or as a folder for information
Leave space in your new sections for non-text items such as seed samples diagrams and pictures of your garden
Cover your gardening journal with a book cover or plastic lamination so that it can safely get wet and dirty
You will want to be able to bring your journal into your garden
Begin entering information such as description of a day's work or planting dates into the appropriate sections of the garden journal
Leave space after each entry so that you can come back later and add notes or edit what you have written
Let your gardening journal evolve as the growing season goes on adding new sections including a second volume inserting additional paper
