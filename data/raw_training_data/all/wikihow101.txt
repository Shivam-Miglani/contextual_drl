This lantern is a little bit different from the rest
You can't hang it anywhere because it is made from glass
You can however use it as a real candleholder
Try not to get it wet however you can wipe it clean with a damp cloth but if you leave it sitting in water the Mod Podge will flake off
Here's what you'll need to make this lantern
Find a short squat jar
You want the jar to be low with a wide mouth
It should be almost round or square in shape
Clean the jar well and dry it off
Use soap and warm water to wash it
You can also wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked in some rubbing alcohol
If there are any labels on the jar be sure to remove them or they will show up when you are done
Cut or tear red tissue paper into small pieces
The pieces should be proportionate to the jar
For a very small jar make the pieces about 1 inch (254 centimeters) big
For a larger jar try something that is about 3 inches (762 centimeters) big
Paint the entire jar using Mod Podge
You can use a paintbrush or a foam brush
If you are working on a large jar you can paint a small section first
If you don't have any Mod Podge you can mix one part white school glue with one part water
Cover the entire jar with tissue paper including the neck
Use your fingers or your paintbrushfoam brush to smooth the paper down so that you don't get any wrinkles
Try not to overlap the tissue paper too much or the light won't shine through as well
It's okay if the tissue paper extends past the neck
You want the next to be covered so that the paint will have something to stick to
Wait for the jar to dry then paint it with another layer of Mod Podge
This will seal the jar
Trim the excess tissue paper off
Use your scissors to trim off the excess tissue paper from the top of the jar
Paint the top edgeneck of the jar black
Squirt some black paint out onto a paper plate or a palette
Dip your paintbrush into the paint and paint the entire neck of the jar black
This will resemble the top of the lantern
Decorate the jar
Use a black marker or glitter glue to draw some symbols onto the lantern
You can use Chinese characters dragons yin-yang and so forth
You can also glue on some sequins or loose glitter onto the lantern as well
Let the lantern dry completely before you use it
You can use a real tea light inside the lantern or a battery-operated tea light
