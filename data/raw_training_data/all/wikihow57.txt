Look for mold growth throughout your home
Mold will typically grow on ceilings walls or in areas exposed to a lot of moisture
Pay special attention to the areas behind your sink toilet or next to your showertubs in bathrooms
In addition keep an eye underneath your kitchen sink as moisture there could lead to mold growth
Mold will first appear as small black green or brown spots
Note if you smell a musty or mildew smell
Walk around your home and notice if you smell any musty or earthy scents
If you smell odors that you’d recognize in the forest or outside it is likely that you have mold or mildew growth and need a dehumidifier to lower the humidity level
Pay specific attention to musty or mildew smells in garages attics or basements
Reflect on whether you suffer from allergies
If you sneeze cough wheeze or have a runny nose or eyes you may be experiencing mold or bacteria-related allergies
This could be the result of mold growth in your home due to a high humidity level
Ultimately a dehumidifier will starve mold and mildew of moisture and limit their growth
Test your home’s air quality
Purchase an air quality kit or hire an environmental testing service to do so
By testing your home’s air quality you’ll be able to identify mold mildew or other contaminants that are in the air
If you find a high level of mold or mildew you may need a dehumidifier in your home
Air quality tests can also help you identify other air quality concerns like asbestos or radon
