Use a tall bookcase for functional division
A bookcase reaching above head height effectively divides the room while providing storage or decoration space
Many people use an open-backed bookcase for this purpose in order to allow light through
Consider curtains or hanging panels if you plan on changing d√©cor regularly
Curtains hanging from the ceiling can be easily installed and removed making them a good option if you want the option of changing the color or style of your divider
Hanging panels have similar benefits and can be purchased in shorter lengths if you do not wish the rooms to be completely blocked off
You can install light ceiling-mounted curtains yourself by mounting extra-light cable across the ceiling with hook screws
You may want to consult an experienced handyman to find out which screws will work best for your wall and ceiling material
Try sliding doors or panels for a more solid division
These installations are made from solid materials usually wood or semi-opaque glass and can block sound and smell more effectively than other options
Nevertheless they can still slide out of the way when you wish to open up the room
Sliding doors can be difficult to install without an existing opening
Hiring a professional is recommended unless you are experienced at home alterations
Use long low furniture to divide the room without blocking vision
A large room doesn't always need barriers to feel divided
Place a long sofa with a low or nonexistent back across the center of the room to break the room up into sections while still allowing people to talk across it
This is a great solution if you wish to host a large number of guests but dislike the empty or bare feeling of the room large enough to host them all
Similarly a kitchen counter or bar counter can divide a large room into a kitchen and dining area
Consider a screen or room divider that suits your style
A paneled room divider can be made of glass fabric wood or other materials and can be painted or decorated in any style
A transparent divider will let light through to keep the hint of a larger room while an opaque one will create a more solid effect
Dividers require no special installation and can easily be moved if you change your mind
Room dividers may not be appropriate if there are energetic pets or children in your home as they can be knocked over
