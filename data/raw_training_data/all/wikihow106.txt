Locate the access panel on the outside of the furnace
This is below the return-air duct between the blower system and the duct
Usually the filter is found inside the front of the furnace
You may need to unscrew the front panel from the furnace or remove it from hooks that hold it in place in order to access the filter
Your furnace filter may also have its own access door
Make sure to turn of the furnace andor HVAC system before opening it
Remove the filter by pulling it up and out of the tracks
Generally the filter should come out quite easily
To prevent damage to the filter andor furnace don’t force the filter out
If it seems stuck look carefully and see if anything (like dirt or debris) is blocking it
Inspect the filter for dirt or damage
If the filter appears dirty it needs to be cleaned or replaced depending upon the filter type
If you are unsure whether your filter is dirty hold it up to the light and look through it
If you cannot see the light the filter is dirty and needs to be replaced
A dirty filter will circulate dirt and dust through your home instead of usable clean air and will force your furnace to work harder to push air through the grime
If your filter is not disposable it must be cleaned
First remove any dirt or loose particles
Generally a mild soap and tap water can then be used to rinse and wash the filter
Make sure to let the filter dry thoroughly before putting it back in the furnace
Many furnaces use a disposable filter
If this applies to yours take the old filter to a hardware or appliance store (or record the size andor model number) and purchase a replacement filter of the same type or model
Place the new or newly cleaned filter back into the furnace
Slide the filter back into the furnace so that it fits securely
Then close the access door or reapply the furnace’s front panel using the hooks or screws
If the filter doesn’t seem to fit properly make sure that no dirt or debris is blocking it
If you have a new filter that doesn’t seem to fit right double-check that you purchased the correct type or size
Remember to inspect your filter regularly
Furnace filters will need to be cleaned or replaced three or four times a year
Set reminders on your calendar to inspect yours regularly
For instance you can check your filter on the first day of each season of the year
