Scrape off extra grease or oil
Before acting to clean an oil stain you need to remove any extra grease or oil
By removing extra grease or oil you’ll ensure that the stain does not spread and you’ll make it easier for the cleaning products you use to fight the stain
Take a razor blade or another thin object and slide it between the oil and the object you’re cleaning
If you’re cleaning a fabric you may want to substitute the razor for a thin piece of plastic or a thin piece of cardboard
When you scrape excess oil off make sure you do so slowly so you don’t spread it and make the stain bigger
Blot the stain
After removing excess grease or oil you’ll need to blot the stain
By blotting the stain you’ll gently remove any grease or oil you didn’t already remove when you scraped the object
Bunch up clean paper towels or an old cloth and Gently dab or blot it on the stain
Don’t mush the fabric down
Avoid smearing any residual grease or oil left after you scraped it
Sprinkle baby powder or cornstarch on the stain
While you’ve probably already removed a substantial amount of grease or oil from the item in question you can remove even more by sprinkling baby powder or cornstarch on the stain
This is important as baby powder or corn starch are very absorbent and will help remove even more oil or grease
Take your baby powder or cornstarch and lightly sprinkle it on top of the stain
‘ If you’re cleaning a stain off concrete you may need to use more
If you’re cleaning a stain off fabric make sure not to use too much – it might cause problems when it comes time to launder the fabric
Carefully remove the baby powder or cornstarch with a scraper vacuum or paper towel
