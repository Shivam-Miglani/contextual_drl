Cleaning windows can be time consuming and sometimes streaks can be left behind
This can be frustrating but I've got an easy fix for that
I'm going to show you how to clean your windows without streaks so you can enjoy the view outside of your windows -- instead of staring at the streaks
Spray the glass surface thoroughly using your window cleaner
Use a paper towel to wipe away dirt smudges and fingerprints
Use a squeegee to wipe away the window cleaner and dirt
Between passes be sure to wipe the squeegee off with a clean paper towel so you don't spread the dirt back onto the window
