Cover the stained area with baking soda or corn starch
Sprinkle the powder liberally and don’t worry about using too much
Both baking soda or corn starch are absorbents that will “soak up” moisture especially oil
They will not stain or damage carpeting
One advantage of baking soda or corn starch is that they are very inexpensive
Another advantage is that they are non-toxic and made from organic materials
Neither baking soda nor corn starch will have a negative effect on the environment or on your body
Rub the baking soda or corn starch into the carpeting
Avoid rubbing too softly or too harshly
Use just enough force for the baking soda or corn starch to penetrate into the carpet’s fibers
Use a utility brush for larger oil stains and an old toothbrush for small stains
Allow the baking soda or corn starch to set and then vacuum it up
This means leaving the powder alone for at least 15 minutes
Now that the baking soda or corn starch has absorbed the oil use a vacuum cleaner to suck it out of your carpeting
Vacuum very thoroughly to remove every last bit of powder
Squirt a few drops of liquid dishwashing detergent onto the stained area
Rub the detergent into the carpeting with a utility brush or an old toothbrush
Pour a small amount of warm water over the area and immediately blot up the detergent with a clean cloth or sponge
Don’t be alarmed if the process creates soap suds just keep blotting until all of the detergent is removed and the carpet is relatively dry
The more detergent and water you use the longer the process will take
Allow the carpeting to dry completely
Inspect the fibres carefully for traces of oil
Repeat the process if the stain is still visible
