Use evergreen branches
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet
Hang lettering on your door
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters
Decorate with ornaments
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes
Incorporate natural decorations
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March
