Apply your choice of cleaning agent
After you’ve removed excess oil or grease you can apply cleaning products to the item
Your choice of products will vary depending on the type of item you’re cleaning
Follow the directions of the cleaning product and pour or spray the recommended amount on the item you are cleaning
If you’re washing fabrics you’ll probably want to use something that is not very caustic and won’t harm the fabric during the cleaning process
For example you may want to use a stain remover formulated for fabric
You may also consider using Dawn or a similar dish detergent
However be aware that harsh detergents may damage some fabric products
If you’re cleaning concrete wood or plastic you may be able to use commercial or industrial products
However you may also have a lot of success using regular household dish detergents like Dawn
Allow the cleaning product to sit
Make sure to provide enough time for the cleaning agent to sit on the item and soak in before rubbing scrubbing or laundering it
This is important as the product needs to be able to attack the stain before you work it
If you’re cleaning concrete many people recommend letting the cleaning product sit for 15 minutes or more
Follow the directions of whatever cleaning item you are using
Some products like Spot Shot recommend you let the item sit for 3 to 5 minutes others recommend more time
Rub or scrub the stain
Depending on the item in question you’ll have to take different approaches to rubbing or scrubbing the stain once you’ve applied a cleaning agent
Be careful as some items are more delicate than others
Employ a toothbrush or a small scrubber for tough fabrics like denim
Find a larger scrubber or a coarse cloth to clean concrete or other hard materials
Use a microfiber rag and dab or massage cottons or synthetic fabrics
This works especially well with car seats or dress shirts
