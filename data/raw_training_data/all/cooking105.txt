I'd love to take credit for this recipe it is the best sangria I've ever had including the sangria I had in Spain
It has a cult following among those who have had it and it's the most requested recipe for sangria I've ever seen
The credit for this recipe goes to my sister and the years she spent drinking tweaking and serving it at parties showers housewarming and backyard cookouts
It's hardly a summer party without it
Make sure to keep the link to this handy because once you make it you'll never make it another way again
Stir in the wine sugar peach nectar and schnapps
This is an important step in developing the flavor don't skip it
Frozen peaches will help to keep the sangria cold without watering it down
