Sift the flour baking soda baking powder sugar and salt into a bowl to mix them well
Beat the egg
Pour the soured milk into the flour mixture and whisk

Whisk just until your mixture is smooth with no lumps
Do not overbeat the mixture
Grease a skillet very lightly with oil and put on medium heat
Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan
Let it spread to form your pancake
When large bubbles form on the surface of the batter and your cake is firm enough to flip flip the pancake with a spatula
Cook until the other side is golden brown as well
Serve the pancakes immediately while they're warm
