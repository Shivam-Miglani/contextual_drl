If you are using frozen turkey thaw it first in the refrigerator
An 8 to 12 pound turkey will thaw in 2 to 3 days while a larger turkey of 20 pounds may take up to five days
Make sure that the ice has melted completed inside and out before you use the turkey
Remove the thawed turkey from the refrigerator about an hour before cooking to allow it to reach room temperature
Preheat oven to 475F
Remove giblets and neck bones from the inside of the turkey
The giblets can be boiled and used later for turkey gravy
Melt the butter in a skillet
Mix in the rosemary and thyme
Separate the skin on the breast from the meat and brush some of the herb-and-butter mixture between the breast meat and the skin
Make sure you do not put the butter mixture outside of the skin
Rub a little salt and pepper all over the turkey's skin
Place the turkey on a rack in a baking dish breast side down
This will help make the breast part very juicy
Do not put any stuffing into the turkey yet
Cook the turkey at 475F for about 20 minutes then reduce the temperature to 250F and cook the turkey for 20 more minutes per pound
Start timing from the moment you turn the heat down
Don't wait for the temperature to reach 250F before you start timing
When you reach only 1/3 of the cooking time is left check the turkey by inserting a meat thermometer into the thigh
If the temperature there is at 180F your turkey is done and you can take it out and just keep it warm
You don't want to overcook your turkey
Once your turkey is done you can put your cooked stuffing into it
Then give your turkey 20 minutes to rest before serving so its juices have time to redistribute properly
Enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner
