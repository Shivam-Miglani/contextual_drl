If we all made a list of the foods we just can't stop eating
I'm certain that most of us would have spinach artichoke dip somewhere in the top five
The creamy dreamy way it clings to bread or chips the tang of the cream cheese and the bite of the artichokes make this appetizer just too good to pass up
It's a household favorite and this version is just as easy as it is delicious it'll be your new go-to recipe
Squeeze all of the water out of the spinach
Stir together the spinach with all remaining ingredients reserving 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese for the topping
Add to an 8 x 8 baking dish top with remaining cheese
Bake at 375 F for 20 minutes or until the top is bubbly and just starting to turn golden brown in spots
Serve warm with bread or chips
