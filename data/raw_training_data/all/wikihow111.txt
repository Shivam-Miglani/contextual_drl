Create a solution with warm water and mild dish soap
Fill your sink or a bucket with warm water and a small amount of mild dishwashing soap
Too much soap can leave a cloudy film so only use a little bit
Swirl or agitate the water to mix the solution thoroughly
Line the bottom of the sink or bucket with a rubber mat soft cloth or even paper towels to prevent damage to your crystal
Submerge your crystal in the solution
You’ll want to do one piece at a time to prevent the items from clanking together which could cause chipping or breakage
If needed allow your crystal to soak for a few minutes
If your item is too big to fit in the sink or bucket or cannot be fully submerged such as a lamp or chandelier dampen a soft cloth or sponge in the solution and use it to carefully wipe down the item
Wash your crystal carefully with a cloth
Use a soft cloth or sponge for washing your crystal to avoid scratches
Gently rub the sponge or cloth on the surface of the crystal in a circular motion and be sure to clean the entire item inside and out
If your item has a narrow opening try using a baby bottle brush to move a sponge or soft cloth around the inside of the item
Some crystal is etched with language or artistic designs use a soft-bristled toothbrush dipped in the warm water mixture to brush dust and dirt out of the etchings
Rinse thoroughly
Use warm running water to rinse away any residue from the crystal
You may want to wear gloves to ensure you aren’t putting fingerprints on your clean crystal
For those larger items use a clean wet cloth or sponge to wipe down the item and remove any lingering soap
You could also rinse your crystal in a bucket or bowl of distilled water as this will reduce the amount of water-spots left behind
Dry your crystal
Gently wipe each item down with a lint-free cloth
This will remove any water spots and give your crystal a beautiful shine
Again it is a good idea to wear gloves to prevent smudging your clean crystal
