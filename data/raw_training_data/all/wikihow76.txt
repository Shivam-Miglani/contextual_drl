Don’t leave cooking food unattended
If you’re frying broiling boiling or grilling any food you must stay in the kitchen
If you need to leave turn off the burner first
If you’re baking broiling or simmering food set a timer and check it regularly
Watch what you’re cooking
Many fires result from cooking at too-high temperatures
Keep an eye on your food and turn off the burner if you see smoke or grease boiling
Turn pot and pan handles toward the back of the stove
Handles hanging over the edge of the stove are a major hazard as they are easily bumped spilling the contents of the pot or pan and potentially causing burns or fire
Turning the handles ensures that people are less likely to bump or run into them
Keep children away from the stovetop
Make a rule that they must stay at least 3 feet away from the cooking area or any area where hot food and drink is being prepared
If you have children consider purchasing a stove guard a barrier that prevents children from touching hot surfaces and protects from burns
Don’t wear long loose sleeves while cooking
Loose clothing can easily drag through food touch open flame or catch on pot handles
Roll up long sleeves or wear close-fit clothing to avoid this hazard
Before you start cooking remove any other loose articles of clothing like scarves or ties
Long hair can cause a similar hazard
Be sure to tie up long hair to keep it out of the way when cooking
Keep any flammable objects away from the stovetop
It’s common to set a towel or potholder next to the stove and forget about it but these objects can easily get too close to a heating element and catch fire
Any flammable objects such as oven mitts curtains wooden utensils and packaging should be kept away from the stove and clear of danger
If your curtains are close to the stovetop consider using blinds instead
Don’t use metal objects in the microwave
Microwaving metal objects like aluminum foil or silverware can create sparks and set off a fire
Keep an oven mitt and metal pot lid nearby while cooking
Having these items on hand can help you to smother small stovetop fires
In the event of a fire turn off the burner and then slide the lid over the fire and hold it there until it feels cool
If you lift the lid too early the fire could start again
With grease fires remember to never fight the fire with water as that will only make it spread
Use the lid technique to suffocate the fire instead
