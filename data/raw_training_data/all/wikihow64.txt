Spot test the cleaner on the grout
Before you dive right into cleaning the grout with the toilet cleaner you should spot test it first on a portion of the grout
Choose a spot that can be covered up or hidden if it gets damaged
Use a small amount of the toilet cleaner on the grout and leave it on for five minutes
If the grout does not appear damaged you can proceed to use the toilet cleaner on the rest of the grout
Pour the cleaner on the grout and let it sit
Do this by pouring the cleaner on the area with grout that is furthest from the door
This way you can clean the grout in small sections moving towards the door and cleaning each section as you go
If you are cleaning grout along a bathtub or a faucet you do not have to worry about doing this
Pour a small amount of the cleaner on the grout
Do not pour too much cleaner on the grout or lay it on too thickly
You want an even amount dispersed on the grout so the cleaner can soak in and remove any dirt or grime
Allow the cleaner to stay on the dirty grout and soak in for five minutes
Do not touch or disturb the cleaner when it is sitting on the grout
Scrub the grout with a toothbrush
Once you have let the cleaner sit on the grout take a toothbrush or a grout cleaning brush and gently run it over the grout
You should not have to scrub the cleaner off the grout very hard to remove any grime or dirt
Often the grime will come off easy by running the brush over the grout
Scrub all of the grout that is covered with the cleaner
You should notice the grout appears clean and grime-free once you scrub it with the brush
Rinse and dry the grout well
It is very important that you rinse off the toilet cleaner as soon as you are done scrubbing the grout with the brush
Do not let the cleaner sit on the tile or the grout once you are done scrubbing it as this can lead to a built up of residue
This may also lead to a stain on the tile or the grout
Use a wet mop or a wet cloth to rinse off the cleaner
You should then dry the grout and the tiles well once the cleaner has been rinsed
Use a towel or soft cloth to do this
Do not use cloth that will scratch the surface of the tile or the grout
