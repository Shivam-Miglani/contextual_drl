Decide what kind of oil cleaning method you want to use
Depending on what kind of stain you have you might use different methods for cleaning the oil off your driveway
If you have an oil stain that is still fresh or if you have a small and stubborn stain you may want to use the poultice method to get out your stain
If your stain is small you can use a common household detergent method to remove the stain
If your stain is large you may want to buy a degreaser or a microbial cleaner to remove the oil
Purchase or get out any materials you need for the job
You can buy all the following materials from Home Depot Lowes online or at your local hardware store
Depending on what kind of stain you have or the method you are using you will have to get different materials
For small stains you will need 1) a detergent (baking soda vinegar soap dish or laundry detergent) 2) a bucket or pot and hose for water 3) a steel brush or stiff brush with stiff bristles If you have a small hard to remove stain use the poultice method 1) kitty litter 2) acetone lacquer thinner or xylene 3) a sheet of plastic slightly larger than the size of your stain 4) a steel brush or stiff brush with stiff bristles For larger stains you will need 1) a degreaser or microbial cleaner (buy online) If you have fresh stains or anticipate further oil leaks consider buying a bag of baking soda or kitty litter to keep in your garage to use in the future
Wear protective clothing and gear if you are using degreasers
Wear goggles or eye protection to shield your eyes from the chemicals
Find chemical resistant gloves at a superstore or hardware store to wear while you scrub
Additionally wear overalls you would use for working on a car if you have them
Or you can wear clothes that cover your arms and legs and that you donâ€™t mind getting stained or dirty
Locate the number of poison control and keep pets or small children away from chemicals
Keep your pets and kids inside while you work
In case of any accidents have the number of poison control written down or recorded in your phone
You can call poison control 24 hours a day 7 days a week- the number for poison control is 1 (800) 222-1222
Clean the area with oil stains with water from a hose or bucket
Prior to cleaning the pavement wash off any dirt and debris that is in the way of the oil stain on your driveway
However do not use a high pressure hose to clean off the affected area because you could end up pushing the oil deeper into the pavement
