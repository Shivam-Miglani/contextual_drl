Use furniture to divide your apartment into "sub-rooms" The main room of a studio functions as three spaces in one a bedroom living room and kitchen
You can create the feeling of three separate rooms by using the furniture to section off areas
Couches armchairs or loveseats can box off a "living room" area
Your bed can similarly separate your sleeping area
Rugs coffee tables or shelves can anchor your apartment furniture and make your apartment sub-rooms feel more organized
Place the bed directly against a wall
Your bed should be placed either parallel or perpendicular to a wall
If you place your bed in the center of the room your studio will feel cramped and cluttered
Consider investing in a day bed or pull-out bed if you are short on space
For additional space choose a low-rise bed without a frame
This will prevent your bed from obstructing windows or blocking up extra space
Install moveable dividers
Incorporating dividers can help you separate your studio apartment into separate areas
When guests are over you can divide off your sleeping area for a sense of privacy
Folding screen or ceiling-mounted drapes can take up minimal space in your studio when they're not being used
Try to section off the room into aesthetically-pleasing ratios
Room sections look most pleasing to the eye if they are divided up into 13 or 23 proportions
Think vertically with storage space
To get the most out of your shelves choose ones that are tall and thin
You will be able to utilize more space for your belongings without choosing a massive storage system
A large bookshelf or wardrobe can serve as a great separator between your sleeping area and living area
Placing high shelves above doorways or windows can also draw the eye upward (again giving the impression of a larger space) and give you more space in your studio
Choose furniture with visible legs
The furniture you choose can help with the illusion of space
Couches or chairs with visible legs (as opposed to legs draped over with cloth) create a feeling of light and airiness
The space between the floor and your furniture will help with an open floor plan
Clear a pathway
Avoid setting your furniture in the middle of the room where it can block your space from one end to the other
Pushing most of your furniture to the edges will maximize open space and avoid a claustrophobic atmosphere
Assess this by walking from one end of the studio to the other
If you can do so without much hassle you have a clear pathway
Pick your furniture carefully
When arranging furniture in studio apartments pick quality over quantity too many chairs or sofas in a small space can leave you feeling trapped
When making the choice between two small couches or one large one always opt for the latter
