How to make pot pie
Prepare the crust by mixing flour salt and shortening in one large bowl
Add water and continue to roll until the dough is ready
Now roll it out to make a large rectangle
Arrange the pie crust in to a 9 inch deep dish pie pan
Now prepare the filling for the pie
Put butter or margarine in a large sauce pan and let it melt
Add chopped onions and celery in to it
Once the onion turns light brown add chicken and vegetables and gently saute them
Sprinkle the remaining flour on the top of the vegetables and stir it up completely
Pour bouillon or condensed potato soup in to the saucepan
Mix everything till the flour completely dissolves
Add seasoning chicken seasoning pepper and salt continue heating till it boils
Pour the gravy mixture into a ungreased 9 inch pie pan
Spread it evenly in the pan and arrange the remaining dough on the top of this mixture
Make sure the filling is still hot while you place the dough onto it
This will make the filling of the pot pie tender and flaky
Seal and trim your pot pie on the edges to give it a clean look
Make a slit in the centre of the pie
Bake it in a 450-degree oven for about 30 minutes or until the top crust is golden brown and the gravy is bubbling inside the hot pie
The best way to make sure the crust stays together is to keep it cool
So let it stand for 10 to 20 minutes before serving
