Remove all of your linens from their cabinets twice per year in order to do an overhaul
Clean the sides of your linen cabinets with an all-purpose cleaner when you remove all of the linens
Go through all your linens and decide if you want to give any away or donate them to the local thrift store
If you are keeping too many linens in 1 cabinet or drawer it may be hard to ensure they are organized and clean
Wash linens if they smell dusty dirty or moldy
They can easily become stagnant in a drawer especially if you keep them in an old piece of furniture or built in cabinet
Wash your larger linens with a very gentle detergent and lukewarm water
Do not use bleach on colored items
Wash smaller or delicate items by hand in a sink with lukewarm water and a small amount of gentle detergent
Use an extra rinse cycle if your table linens are very dirty
You can also use more detergent in this case
Rinse washed linens well
Soap left in the fibers will scorch when ironed
Bleach white linens with a hydrogen-peroxide based bleach
If you are washing them by hand use a cream conditioner on your last rinse to make the white linens soft
Dry them on a clothesline whenever possible
It is a good idea to do your linen cleaning in spring summer or early fall when the weather is nice enough to allow line drying
If you have to use a machine dryer only leave the linens in for half the cycle
Take them out and hang them over a rack until they are almost completely dry
Iron linens when they are still slightly wet on a medium to high setting
If your cloth has a design or embroidery iron it from the inside so you don't risk hurting the designs
Starch linens using spray starch and a medium iron setting
This is a step that applies mostly for formal linen use
Organize your linens by type
Separate them by type and stack them so the most used linens like towels are near the top
If your family is hunting for 1 of these popular items they will not disturb or remove linens during their search if their item is on top
Store your linens in a place that will not attract mildew
For instance a cupboard in or very near the bathroom would not be a good place to keep them
Make sure your linens are completely dry before storing them
Place sets of linens in linen or cloth bags and close them tightly
Seal them in a plastic bag if you are going to use them within a month or two
You can find large plastic bags at most home stores
After cleaning the linens fold them neatly and place them in a sealed plastic bag without exposure to oxygen they will remain fresh until you need to use them
