Check whether your species and variety produces different colors
Some varieties of hydrangea can bloom pink or blue depending on the soil's aluminum content and acidity
Most cultivated hydrangeas of this type belong to the species Hydrangea macrophylla but some members of this species only produce white blooms or favor the pink or blue side too heavily for easy adjustment
Ask the previous owner of the hydrangeas to identify your hydrangea variety if you are not aware of its name
The varieties named Enziandom Kasteln Merritt's Supreme Red Star and Rose Supreme all have the ability to be grown as pink or blue blossoms although they vary in intensity
Test soil pH
Most garden supply stores sell a pH test kit for measuring the pH or acidity of your soil
Because acidity affects the hydrangea's ability to take in aluminum which in turn affects the flower color you can get a rough prediction of the flower color by measuring the soil pH
As a rule of thumb a soil pH below 55 will likely result in blue flowers and a soil pH of 7 and up will likely result in pink or red flowers
The effects of soil pH levels between 55 and 7 are difficult to predict
They may result in blue pink or purple flowers or in a blotched blue and pink pattern
Turn blooms blue
To encourage a blue color during the growing season mix 1 tbsp (15 mL) aluminum sulfate into a gallon of water
This both adds aluminum to the soil and increases the acidity (lowering pH) making it easier for the plant to use the aluminum
Once every 10â€“14 days Apply as much of this water as you would in a normal watering
Continue to measure the pH of the soil and stop applying once it drops below 55 pH
Alternatively you can also create blue blossoms by applying a fertilizer that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium
Look for a 25530 fertilizer blend
You'll also want to avoid superphosphates and bone meal
Encourage pink blooms
If the hydrangea is already blue it is hard to make it pink due to the existing presence of aluminum causing a blue color
However you can take precautions in advance to encourage pink blooms or you can grow your plants in a pot
Avoid planting near driveways or walls as some concrete mixes or mortars can leach aluminum into the soil
Apply a fertilizer that contains no aluminum but high levels of phosphorus which inhibits aluminum uptake
Look for a fertilizer that contains a 25-10-10 blend
Consider raising the pH by adding wood ash or crushed limestone to the soil as this also makes aluminum uptake difficult
Avoid raising the pH higher than 64 or the plant may develop health problems
