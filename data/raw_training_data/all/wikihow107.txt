Make sure all lights are turned off in your office at the end of the day
To conserve electricity create an office policy to ensure all the lights in your office are turned off including lights in bathrooms kitchen areas and meeting rooms
You should also tell your employees to switch off lights in a room if they are going to be out of there for longer than a few minutes at a time
During the day maximize natural daylight by using natural light instead of overhead or fluorescent lights
Turning off one fluorescent light for an hour a day can save 30 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per year
Consider areas in the office where there is excessive lighting or lights that are turned on in rooms that are barely used
Remove these lights or suggest not using lights if daylight is enough
As well switch the light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs such as compact fluorescent (CFL) or LED bulbs to save more energy
Install weather strips on doors and around windows
This will prevent air from escaping your office when the air conditioner or heater is running which can be especially important for offices located in regions of the country that experience extreme temperatures
You can also prevent drafts in the office by keeping the front doors of the office closed and making sure the door shuts firmly behind someone as they leave so heat or air does not escape to the outside
You should also clean and repair your office's heating venting and air conditioning (HVAC) system on a routine basis or hire a repairman to come at least once a month
A clean and working HVAC system will help reduce your energy bills and make it easier for your officeâ€™s HVAC system to cool or heat your office
Make sure all air vents are clear of paper files and other office supplies
Blocked air vents means your HVAC system has to work harder and use more energy to circulate cold or warm air in the office
Modify the temperature in the office based on the season
Conserve your heat energy by setting the thermostat in the office at different temperatures in the winter and in the summer
In the winter set the thermostat at 68 degrees or less during the day and at 55 degrees at night when no one is in the office
In the summer setting the thermostat at 78 degrees or more will also help to reduce energy use in the office
During the winter keep shades and blinds open in the office during a sunny day
This will heat the room naturally
Close the blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost via the windows
In the summer keep shades and blinds closed to avoid overheating the room
As well after office hours and during weekends energy can be saved by increasing the temperature of the thermostat during hot weather and by lowering the temperature in cold weather
