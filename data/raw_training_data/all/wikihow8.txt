Add some personal pictures
They can be photographs or paintings
They can be family-related or something you created yourself
Pictures of animals and landscapes also work
Just make sure that you choose a frame with a style that fits the mantle
For example if your mantle is ornate and covered with gold leaf you wouldn't want to use a rustic wooden frame
Hang a mirror above the mantle to make a small room look larger
Again choose a frame that compliments the mantle
You will also want to use a larger thicker frame for larger mirrors
Add some personal trinkets knickknacks and souvenirs
It can be as simple as a pretty rock or shell you found at the beach or as complex as an antique doll
These personal items can also be spiritual such as a statue of an angel the Virgin Mary or Buddha
They can also be related to your interests
For example if you like sailing consider putting up a model of a sailboat
Bring in some nature with flowers plants or pieces of driftwood
If possible try to use real plants as fake ones (unless they're very high-quality) will make your mantle look cheap
The flowers can be potted or in vases
Here are some ideas to get you started Match flowers to the season
For example you can use poinsettias in the winter and tulips in the spring
Hang garlands from the mantle using hooks
These can be made from fake plants
Ivy works great year-round while evergreen works for winter
Use pieces of driftwood or pinecones if you don't like (or can't have) flowers
They will work great with a natural rustic theme
Add some candles
Use both tall and short pillar candles to add some variety but try to keep them the same color or shade
For example you can use all ivory candles or a mixture of pink and red candles
Consider setting the candles in glass "hurricane" vases or on pretty chargers to keep your mantle clean
Add some cards or postcards
They can be cards that you received for special occasions such as birthdays weddings and baby showers
They can also be related to the current holiday such as Christmas or Easter
Change the cards out every month or so
This will keep your mantle looking interesting throughout the year
For a twist pin a piece of string across the mantle then hang the cards from the string
Take advantage of the holidays
They offer a great excuse to change your mantel
Here are some ideas to get you started For Valentines day place a glass vase filled with red roses in the middle of your mantle
Arrange white or ivory candles to either side of the vase
For Halloween decorate the mantle with pumpkins and fall leaves
For Christmas drape an evergreen garland across your mantle
Decorate it with red berries holly leaves and a few white or ivory pillar candles
