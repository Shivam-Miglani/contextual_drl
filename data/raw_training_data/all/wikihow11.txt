Avoid outdoor areas with lots of dirt or moisture
Find an outdoor location that is dry with little standing water like ponds or puddles
If you're spending a lot of time outdoors find a place that is higher-up like at the top of a hill
Set up a physical barrier between you and the insects
If you spend a lot of time camping or on your backyard deck install a mesh screen around the area you're sitting to keep bugs out
Or if you're planning to walk around wear a mesh head net paired with a long-sleeved shirt and pants
If you are camping cover any tent or cabin openings with a mesh barrier that can allow airflow in while keeping bugs outside
Most outdoor or camping specialty shops sell mesh screens or head nets
Wear a bug repellant spray or wristband
If you plan to spend a lot of time outside and want to avoid bug bites apply bug spray before you go outdoors
Some outdoor clothing brands sell lightweight shirts pants or wristbands to keep bugs from resting or biting your skin
If you do not have insect-repellent spray or clothing layer your clothes with long sleeves and pants to keep bugs from biting your skin
Set up a food trap to divert bugs from your area
Place a bowl of jelly or other sugary food 10-20 feet away from the area you plan to be
This will keep many though not all nearby bugs distracted
Usually 1-2 tablespoons (05-10 oz) of jelly or sugary food is enough to distract bugs
You might also use desserts granulatedpowdered sugar or any other sweet snack you have on hand
Hanging up plastic bags of sugar water around your outdoor perimeter can distract flies
Use garlic to keep bugs away from outdoor lights
Steep 2 or 3 garlic cloves in hot water for about 15 minutes then put the mixture in a spray bottle
Spray the garlic water on your outdoor light bulbs or flashlights every several days
This method works because the heat from the lights emits the smell of garlic which bugs find repellent
Throw sage into a burning fire to deter bugs
When building a campfire or backyard bonfire add a few sticks of dry sage
Sage is more pleasant-smelling than most insect repellents and can work as an alternative to chemical sprays
Sage is especially effective at repelling mosquitoes
Light citronella candles to keep mosquitos at bay
Citronella is a sweet-smelling fragrance that repels mosquitos
Light 2 or 3 citronella candles nearby while outdoors to avoid mosquito bites
Citronella candles can also be used indoors if you have a persistent mosquito problem
