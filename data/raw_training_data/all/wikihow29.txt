Choose an appropriate degreaser or soap
After you've cleaned up the excess grease you'll want to use a degreaser or soap to prevent the grease from setting
The product you choose will weaken the grease and help separate it from any surface it is on
Use an appropriate degreaser product for metal materials
Quick Degreaser should work well on grease stains on concrete or similar surfaces
Use dish detergent or laundry soap for fabrics and carpet
For example Dawn soap works great against grease on a variety of materials
Pick an appropriate product if you have hardwood or wood laminate in your home
Apply soap or a similar product immediately
Once you’ve cleaned up excess grease you need to apply a soap product immediately
By applying the product quickly you’ll stop the grease from soaking in and bonding with whatever material it has been spilled on
If you’re cleaning grease on a fabric mix the soap or detergent with warm water and apply it
If you’re cleaning grease on a hard surface apply your degreaser or a soap and water mixture liberally
Allow the soap or degreaser to sit for several minutes
Rub or dab the product after you’ve applied it
Some products and surfaces will benefit from you rubbing or dabbing the cleaning product onto the grease spot
By doing this you'll help the product penetrate the surface better
Feel free to scrub hard surfaces with an abrasive pad or something similar
Avoid rubbing or scrubbing fabric surfaces
If the directions on a cleaning product instruct you to dab it into the grease spot do so
Rinse or soak the product
After you’ve applied your product and allowed it to sit you’ll need to either rinse or soak the product
While some fabrics like clothes can soak hard surfaces like concrete should be rinsed
Allow fabrics to soak in hot water with your chosen soap product for up to an hour
Rinse and examine the fabric after it soaks
You may need to apply more soap and soak the product again
Rinse hard surfaces like concrete after the you’ve scrubbed and applied your chosen cleaning product
