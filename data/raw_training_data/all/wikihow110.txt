Remove as much dirt debris or liquid from the carpet as possible
Before applying any stain remover clean up any solid material that is over the stain
This prevents you from pressing any dirt further into the carpet fibers
Vacuum up dry crumbly material
Scrape anything sticky off the carpet with a Popsicle stick or butter knife
Soak up excess liquid with a paper towel
Blot the affected area
Before applying the remover blot the stain with a dry or lightly damp rag or cloth working from the outside in
Don’t scrub the stain as scrubbing can press the stain further into your carpet or rug whereas blotting will help to lift the stain out
Use a white cloth or paper towel without any designs or ink printing
Any color on your rag or paper towel can rub off and further stain your carpet
Apply a carpet stain removal solution to the stained area
Spray the stain with your solution but don’t drown the stain
You want to allow the solution to work into the carpet without ruining it
Buy cleaning solutions in the cleaning sections of most stores
Most stores have a variety of products some of which are tailored to specific stains
Avoid using any stain removing cleaners that contain bleach unless you have a pure white carpet
Allow the solution to soak into the stain for 10 minutes or whatever amount of time is recommended on the bottle of your store bought solution
Keep children and pets away from carpeted areas topped with store-bought solution as the chemicals can be bad if inhaled or ingested
Blot the stained area with a paper towel rag or special carpet-cleaning tool
The stain should blot away
If you can still see it apply the solution again and continue blotting once it has soaked for the recommended amount of time
Keep a dry cloth or rag nearby if you have to keep applying solution to the stain
Frequently blot the area with your dry cloth to prevent the carpet from getting soaked
Dab a washcloth in distilled water and blot over the freshly-cleaned area to rinse off any remnants of cleaning solution
Blot the area dry with a clean paper towel or washcloth to dry the carpet
Dab and blot the stained area to lift the stain
You don’t want to rub the area as that may soak the stain into the fibers of the carpet
Mix in 1 teaspoon (49 ml) of white vinegar to your water if the stain is proving tough to remove
Vacuum the area
Quickly go over the area with a vacuum to straighten the carpet back up and to prevent any part of the stain still remaining deep in the carpet from rising up to view
