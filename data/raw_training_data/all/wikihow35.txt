Start with the outside edges of the book
Keep the book firmly closed and use your soft cloth or toothbrush to gently brush the edges of the pages
Start at the top or head and wipe away from the spine
Continue with the fore-edge or the edge opposite the spine and the tail or bottom of the book
Use extreme caution with any tears or damaged edges
Use the soft brush to very gently address these spots
Brush the spine and outer boards of the book
Wipe the spine with your cloth or brush moving in one direction only
In order to protect the boards mentally divide the front and back cover into halves and wipe from that center rather than from one end to the other
If the spine has raised horizontal bands wipe across rather than up and over the bumps
Be careful of any damaged edges leather corners or decoration
Avoid snagging the brush or cloth on these elements
Use your vacuum for heavy dust or mold on the outside of the book
Ensure that your attachment is an extremely soft brush and place your vacuum on the lowest possible setting
Gently and carefully vacuum up the dirt moving in only one direction
Start with the head move to the fore-edge then the tail and finally finish with the spine and outer boards
For damaged books place some cheesecloth or a nylon stocking over the end of the vacuum
Vacuum up the dirt on the medium setting without touching the book by hovering just above the surface of the book
Clean the dust jacket
Many books now come with dust jackets
These paper coverings are generally glossy or matte in finish
While they’re attractive they often get dusty and may also tear
Use your soft cloth to gently brush any dust or dirt off the jacket
Clean the pages
Set the book in your wedges carefully open the book and turn the pages
Use your soft cloth or toothbrush to wipe the page from the center of book outwards removing dust as you go
Address mustiness
If your book has a musty smell that you can’t isolate to individual pages place the book in a plastic resealable bag with a sprinkling of baking soda or unscented cat litter
Leave it in the bag for a minimum of 12 hours and up to two weeks
