Pour dye into separate containers
You can use food coloring or liquid water colors
Use a small bowl for each color or put a different color in each compartment of an ice cube tray
Spread out old towels or a vinyl tablecloth to protect the work surface
Dip or brush the paper towels to color them
Use paint brushes or eyedroppers to apply color to the paper towels
If you want more vivid color (and aren’t worried about cleanup) fold each paper towel (at least twice) into a square
Then dip each corner into a different color
Allow any excess water to drop back into the container
Don’t soak the paper towel too deeply or for very long or it will get overly saturated
The towels don’t have to be completely colored – some white areas will look great too
This is a good time to explain color mixing while children observe and experiment
Lay the towels out to dry
Open each paper towel if you had them folded
Spread out the towels on a sunny sidewalk or driveway or nearby a fireplace (not too close!)
Let them sit until they are totally dry to the touch
You may want to flip them over once if they don’t seem to be drying completely
You can use a hairdryer to help the towels dry
If it’s a windy day either dry the paper towels indoors or make sure to weigh the corners down
Secure each paper towel in the middle with a twist tie or pipe cleaner
Bunch the middle of the towel together
Wrap a twist tie or pipe cleaner around the middle and wrap it a couple of times
Fluff out the wings gently with your hands
If you want the wings to have more definition fold the paper towel accordion-style before bunching it together in the middle
Fold one outer edge to form a thin rectangle
Then flip the towel over and fold the rectangle back onto itself
Flip the towel again and repeat until it’s completely pleated
Make antennae with straws or pipe cleaner
If you wrapped pipe cleaner around the middle simply bend or curl the ends to make the antennae
Otherwise you can make them out of bendy straws
Attach two straws to the middle of each butterfly and secure them with tape or hot glue
Decorate further if desired
Add stickers for eyes such as googly eye stickers
Use your imagination and add whatever decorations you like – for example buttons puff balls or colorful stickers
Attach your decorations with hot glue or a bit of double-sided tape
Make sure to follow all instructions age group recommendations and safety precautions when using hot glue
You can hang your butterflies from the ceiling with string or pin them to a bulletin board
