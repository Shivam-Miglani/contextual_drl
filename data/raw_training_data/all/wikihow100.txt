Find a stone
Your skill level and the design you want to create will determine the type of stone you need
Stones with a flat surface such as river rocks work best for beginners
Softer sedimentary rocks (such as sandstone limestone and soapstone) are easier to drill into
Keep your eyes open for stones when you're outside at the beach in your garden etc or purchase engraving stones from your local arts and crafts store
Purchase an electric engraver or rotary tool
Alternatively you can use a point chisel and mallet or hammer to do your engraving but an electric engraver will make the process much easier
Look for an electric engraver or rotary tool that allows you to change out the tip
A carbide tip is appropriate for engraving softer stones like sandstone limestone or soapstone
A diamond tip is best for engraving harder stones or glass
Engraving tips come in various shapes and widths
For a basic design the standard carbide tip that comes with your tool will be enough
Over time you can add to the complexity of your designs by using a cone tip to create detail lines and a cylindrical shaped tip for shading and dimension
Electric engravers or rotary tools can be found at your local hardware store craft store or online
Get a wax-based pencil marker or stencil materials
Sketching your design onto your stone or creating a stencil before you start engraving will save you a lot of missteps along the way
Wax-based pencils china markers or permanent markers can be used to draw your design directly onto the stone
You can make an easy stencil using cardboard or acetate and a craft knife
Beeswax and latex paint are optional design supplies that can be used to add color and shine to your stone
Purchase safety goggles
Safety goggles should be used during all of your engraving projects
Engraving throws small pieces of stone and dust into the air that can damage your eyes
Get a bowl of water
Prepare a bowl of water large enough to submerge the stone
This will be used to cool and clean the stone during the engraving process
