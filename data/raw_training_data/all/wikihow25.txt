Put terracotta statues in your garden
Whether you are growing vegetables flowers or a myriad of other greenery terracotta statues can add a point of interest to any garden
For example add a trio of medium sized terracotta fish to a bed of lavender or geraniums
Not only will the burnt-orange pop against the purple of the flowers but the fish will appear to be swimming
Or instead of a garden gnome set a small terracotta warrior to stand guard next to your tomatoes or spiraling cucumbers
Line porches with terracotta planters
When looking to add flower pots to your deck or patio trade in the stone or porcelain for terracotta
Not only does terracotta breath easier but the porosity of the clay allows moisture to penetrate the pot giving your plants lots of much-needed nutrients
If you have a cement patio or light colored wooden deck try the traditional orange colored pots
Put them in corners or along stairs
On the other hand if you have a darker colored deck try a painted terracotta in a distressed white or cream
Fill these up with flowers of contrasting colors like blues purples and yellows
You donâ€™t have to stick with the traditional smooth terracotta planter either go for pots that mimic Grecian urns and are carved into intricate patterns
Attach small terracotta pots to a fence or wall
An easy design trick is making outdoor collages or murals with miniature planters
Line these pots up in large geometric patterns like squares circles or even stars
You can place them on fences around pools or yards or even on the back wall of your home
Leave them with their common orange color or paint them different shades to stand out against their backdrop
For example if you have a white picket fence use the reddish hues of the pots to create a striking pattern that you can see from far away
Fill these pots with either flowers or herbs!
