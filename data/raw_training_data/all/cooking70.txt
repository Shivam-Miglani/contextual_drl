How to cook crispy chicken karaage
Cooking Crispy Chicken Karaage is not as tough as it sounds
This classic Japanese dish is basically fried chicken without all the grease that stains your hand
If you re craving something new from the orient here's a recipe for Chicken Karaage
Start cutting up the chicken into bite-size pieces and place them in a deep bowl
Grate the ginger and add them into the chicken
Put in the soy sauce and start adding the sake inside
Mix the combination well before leaving the chicken to marinate on the sauce
Thirty minutes should do just fine allowing the chicken to soak in the flavor and become tender
Start coating the chicken pieces with potato starch
If the sauce mixture is too watery you can drain them off first before coating
Make sure that every inch of the chicken is covered since the potato starch adds to the crispy sensation
Start heating the oil preferable hitting 180 degrees Celsius in temperature
This is the perfect heat for the chicken to fry all the way through for that crispy dining experience
Start frying the chicken several pieces at a time
You might want to test the temperature first with a piece of chicken to see if it's hot enough
Remove the pieces when they reach that deep golden brown coloring
Make sure to have a wire rack prepared for draining purposes
You wouldn t want to eat all that oil along with the chicken
In most cases paper towels are used to speed up the draining process
This recipe should provide ten to 12 pieces of fried chicken ideal for 3 to 4 people as part of a bento
It can be served with lemon wedges or some sansho pepper depending on your preferences
Note that some of the ingredients mentioned aren t really readily available in most grocery stores
If you find yourself lacking sake sherry or the Chinese xiaoxing would do
NEVER use vinegar as a substitute for sake since the two are nothing alike
As for potato starch your grocery-variety cornstarch will do just fine for this recipe
Enjoy your Crispy Chicken Karaage
