If you want salted glasses prepare your glasses first
Use a lime wedge to moisten the rim of each glass before dipping the outside of the rim into salt
Make sure only the outside of the glass is salted you don't want salt dropping into your margarita
If you're not sure if your guests want salt or not only put salt one one-half of the glass rim
Set the glasses aside
Now that your glasses are ready it's time to make the margarita
Mix the tequila orange liqueur or triple sec and lime juice in a cocktail shaker or covered pitcher
Add crushed ice
Shake the mixture really well
Strain the mixture into the cocktail glasses
If you want ice put ice into the glasses before you pour the margarita
Place a lime wedge on the rim of each cocktail glass
Serve
Of course you can always raise the amount of the tequila for more buzz the amount of lime juice for more zing or the amount of triple sec or liqueur for more sweetness
True margarita does not need sugar but if you want your margarita sweet feel free to add sugar as is often done anyway
The quality of a margarita mix is determined by the quality of the tequila and triple sec used to make the drink
If you want premium margarita spend on the best bottles of tequila and triple sec
For a slushy version of margarita crush some ice cubes in an ice crusher and mix that with the drinks
You can also skip the cocktail shaker or covered pitcher and just mix the liquid ingredients and ice in a blender to get a shake-like consistency
