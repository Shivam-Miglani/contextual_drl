Wait for the bat to land
Catching a moving bat can injure the bat and risk the bat biting or scratching you out of fear
Be patient and try not to make a lot of noise that scares the bat to encourage it to land
Catching a bat mid-flight can injure the bat or cause it to panic and attempt to bite you
Waiting for the bat to land provides you with the safest opportunity to catch it for both you and the bat
Use a small box or bucket to catch the bat
Once a bat lands and is stationary use a bucket box or similar container to trap the bat
Find a container with a larger inside diameter than the bat is taking up in its stationary position to avoid injuring the bat by crushing a wing or ear
Approach the bat slowly and quietly then quickly place the container over the bat so that it cannot escape
Slide a piece of cardboard or container lid under the container slowly and gently to enclose the bat within the container and lid
Carry the container outside and release the bat back into your yard
While it is preferable that you release a bat after nightfall you should not keep the bat contained until then if you catch one during the day
Catch the bat in a net or blanket
Another viable way to catch the bat is to use a decent sized cloth or net to capture the bat once it has landed
Depending on the thickness of the cloth or net this method may involve more direct contact with the bat
Approach the bat slowly with the cloth or net in front of you
Place the net or cloth over the bat rapidly to avoid giving it an opportunity to fly away
The net may trap the bat immediately
If you are using a cloth towel or blanket place it over the bat then gently wrap the bat up with it
Carry the bat outdoors while still in the net or cloth then release it
It is better for the bat if you release it after nightfall but you should not keep the bat contained until evening if you capture it during the day
