Choose lilac bushes to plant
Visit a nursery to pick out a variety of lilac to grow
In addition to color pay attention to the full-grown height of the plant
Some plants such as Palibin' and Superba lilacs grow into 5 to 6 - foot bushes
Others such as Syringa reticulata become 20 to 30 - foot trees
You can purchase bare-root or container-grown plants from a local nursery or mail order plant supply company
Your local garden center or nursery should be able to recommend lilac varieties that do best in your area
You can also transplant saplings runners from a friend or neighbor's lilac bush
Dig up and transplant saplings from a friend or neighbor's lilac bush in the spring just as leaf buds begin to form or when the newly opened leaves are still small
Choose saplings that are at least 12 inches (305 cm) tall
Use a shovel to dig the saplings out of the ground with as much of a root base as possible
Cut the runners with the shovel blade to separate the sapling from the parent plant
Choose a spot to plant the lilacs
Lilacs need full sun so find a spot that receives at least 6 hours of sun each day and has good air circulation
Lilacs grown in damp stagnant air or without enough sunshine are prone to disease
Lilacs also need well-drained soil
If drainage is a problem create a mound or raised bed for them before planting
Avoid planting lilacs too close to a wall or tree
The lilacs' roots need room to spread out
Get the lilacs ready for planting
If you are planting a dormant lilac soak the roots in tepid water for 10–15 minutes
If they are rootbound or overgrown in their pots loosen the root ball by using your fingers to gently separate the roots
Plan to plant the lilac in the spring or fall
Dig a hole in the soil deep enough to bury the roots
The base of the plant should sit at ground level
After setting the lilac in the hole fill it up halfway with soil then water it before filling up the rest of the hole
Bring the soil level up even with the natural flare at the bottom of the base
Covering the base beyond this point could smother the roots and kill the plant
If the soil where you live isn't very rich add some compost bone meal or fertilizer to the hole before planting the lilac
Use a soil testing kit to find out the pH of the soil
Lilacs prefer a neutral to slightly acidic pH of 5 to 7
If the soil is too acidic sprinkle lime on the soil over the roots of the lilac
Follow manufacturer's application instructions and reapply every 3 to 5 years
If you're planting more than one lilac bush space the holes you dig 5–15 feet (15–46 m) apart depending on what variety you're planting
