Wash the ginger well scrubbing the thin light brown skin off with water
You may also use salt to scrub off the skin
Dilute the salt in a bowl of water
Soak the ginger in the bowl of saltwater for one to two hours
Drain your ginger and let them dry or wipe with paper towels
Slice the ginger thinly with a sharp knife or a mandolin for consistent thickness
Prepare a sterilized jar that you will use as your preservation vessel
It must be completely dry and devoid of any object that may cause odor-causing bacteria
Place the sliced ginger in the jar carefully stacking them one by one so that the space is maximized
In a pot boil your 3 cups of sugar mixed with 1 cup sugar
Upon boiling pour the hot mixture into the ginger-filled jar
Place on the lid and wait for it to cool before placing it in the refrigerator
