Purchase a manufacturer-recommended liquid cleaner
Engineered hardwood floors should only be cleaned with a liquid cleaner that has been manufactured by the company that made the floor
Different types of engineered hardwood require different cleaners and using the wrong type or brand of liquid cleaner could result in serious damage to your hardwood
If you’re not sure which type of cleaner to use contact the manufacturer by phone or email to request a liquid-cleaner recommendation
You can purchase liquid cleaning products designed for engineered hardwood floors at your local hardware store
If a local hardware store does not have them check the “Cleaning” or “Flooring” section or a larger some supply store such as Lowe’s or Home Depot
Scrub spills and stains with the liquid cleaner
If a section of flooring is particularly dirty or if it has been stained or had liquid spilled on it you can clean up with the liquid cleaner
Apply a small amount of liquid cleaner directly to the surface of the hardwood and clean with a sponge mop or a clean cloth
Wipe the hardwood surface until the stain has been removed adding more cleaner as needed
Don’t leave excess liquid cleaner on the floor after you’ve cleaned a stain
Wipe it up immediately with a clean paper towel or cloth
It’s not necessary to rinse the cleaner off using water
To clean small spaces that a mop cannot reach or to wipe up hard-to-reach stains you may need to scrub by hand
Pour a small amount of liquid cleaner onto a clean cotton cloth and dab or wipe gently at the dirty area of your floor
Do not use cleaning products designed for tile or vinyl flooring
Although the cleaning products themselves may look the same and may even be located next to one another on the shelves at a hardware store the products are not interchangeable
Liquids that clean tile or vinyl may permanently damage engineered hardwood
Cleaning products for tile or vinyl will also not fully clean your engineered hardwood floor
If you have questions about substituting cleaning products contact the floor manufacturer and ask which liquid cleaning products may be safely used on their floors
