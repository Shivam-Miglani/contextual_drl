Ask for help
Take the plant or a few leaves flowers and seeds to a greenhouse or nursery that sells houseplants and ask if someone can identify it
If your county Extension office has a horticulturist take the plant to him or her for identification
Take a good clear photo of the plant and some close ups of plant parts and post photos online in garden forums
Ask for help with identification from these online communities
Send photos to plant diagnostic clinics college horticulture departments or other experts for identification
Identify the houseplant yourself
Collect some houseplant reference books making sure that they cover houseplants and not just native plants or garden plants
Some of these helpful references are listed below
Try the library for plant reference books you can look at for free
Ask nurseries and greenhouses if they have references you can look at
The County Extension offices in many US states may also have references you look at or purchase at a nominal fee
Examine the plant carefully
Try to look at a complete specimen with leaves stems roots and any flowers fruits or seeds
Answer these questions if possible and record them in a notebook
Use a hand magnification lens if needed
What color and shape is the flower seed or fruit
Does the flower have male and female sex organs in each flower or flowers with only one type of sex part
See the Tips section for sex part identification
How many petals does the flower have
If it has too many to count just use the term multiple
Does the flower have sepals--the little green leaf-like structures sometimes found on the back of flowers
Split open fruit or seed pods and see if there are sections inside and what the seeds look like if there are any
What shape and size is the leaf
Are the leaves divided into lobes or leaflets
What is the shape of the leaf’s edge
Is it smooth or does it have small “teeth” or big jagged “teeth”
How do the leaves attach to the stem
How do the branches attach to the trunk (if it has any)
Are they arranged opposite each other or alternately on the stem or is there no visible stem
Does the leaf have hairs
What color is the leaf on the front and back
Look at the shape of the stem and its color
Look at the root system to see if it is fibrous tap rooted or does it have bulbs or tubers
Search your reference books for a match
Look for a plant that seems to look like your plant
Read the description of the plant and compare it to your observations
Compare the description of each part don’t stop with just the flower or leaf if you have other parts to compare
Record the name including the Latin name when you have a match and label your plant
