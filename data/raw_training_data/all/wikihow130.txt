Prune a select few trees in summer or fall
These trees can leak sap onto the ground below if pruned in the late fall or winter
Maples elms walnuts dogwoods and birches should be pruned earlier than other trees or shrubs
Wait until all the leaves fall off before you start to prune other fruit trees or bushes
You will have a better idea about the shape of the tree and the tree will have started to go dormant
For example prunes crab apples honey locust poplar sumac spruce juniper cherry bald cypress Bradford pears and Callery pears should all be pruned at this late time of the year
In addition shrubs like camellias hydrangeas beauty berries mallow and barberries should be pruned at this time as well
Try to prune the trees before the snow or extreme temperatures hit
You want to choose a time in mild winter or late fall to begin your pruning on shrubs and trees
Assess your trees or shrubs to find dead or dying branches
These are the first things you should prune with sharp pruning shears
Always cut at an angle like that of the branch collar
The branch collar is the bark where the branch meets the trunk
Make sure your pruning mirrors that angle
However do not cut into the branch collar
Cut large branches in 3 parts
This will allow you easier access if you cut in thirds
It will also help to ensure the branch doesn't rip off on its own
It is much better for the tree to have a clean cut with pruning shears than to rip it off
Check your tree for disease
You will need to be extra careful during pruning if disease is a problem
Wait until the tree is not wet
Water can spread disease so prune on dry days
Pick a place to prune below the diseased portion
This will help you to stop the infection
Clean your pruning shears between cuts with a solution of water with 10 percent bleach
This can kill disease and stop it from spreading
Make sure to do this before starting on another tree that has no signs of disease
Prune 2 branches if they cross
Choose to cut the smaller branch of the 2
Take note of any areas along pathways or grass
Cut back branches to avoid breakage in the future
Places with a lot of traffic or mowing can lead to breakages making the tree more susceptible to disease
Thin branches of both trees and shrubs
This will allow sunlight and air to reach the center of the plant
It will promote photosynthesis
Don't scalp your trees or shrubs only pruning the top
Cut according to the tree's natural shape
Trying to shape it with a flat top is likely to promote weak growth rather than strong natural growth
