Remove any tackstrips that have been left on the floor
If you're not going to reinstall carpet on the new floor pull up the tackstrips by hand
They should come up relatively easily as long as you're wearing your heavy gloves
Use the pry-bar if necessary
If you are going to reinstall carpeting inspect the tackstrips for wear and determine whether or not they're reusable
If they're dull loose or otherwise worn out consider pulling them up and replacing them anyway
It's also a good idea to keep an eye out for any extra carpet nails screws or tacks that might be on the floor after removing the carpet
Sweep them or gather them up by hand and throw them out
Sometimes there'll be a lot of staples which can be a pain to remove
Use your pliers to pull them up and make sure you get them all
Scrape the glue off the subfloor with your prybar or knife
Carpeting uses different types of adhesives and some require a simple scraping while others will require a more thorough cleaning
Clean up the sub-floor as best as possible
Look for a floor cleaner that removes adhesives if scraping doesn't the glue off like you want
You can find it in your local hardware store
Check the condition of the subfloor
It's very important regardless of what you want to do with the room next that you inspect the condition of the subfloor and make any repairs necessary while you've got the carpet off
It'd be a shame to install $800 worth of new carpet over a squeaky floor or a floor showing signs of mold
Walk around the sub-floor and bounce on it
Subfloor panels should be attached to the wood joists with screws or nails and if you find some panels that squeak you can secure it to the joist with ring shank nails
These are grooved nails with more secure gripping power decreasing the chances that this squeaky area will ever squeak again
About two or three inches from the previous nail or screw hammer in a shank nail and you'll be set
If your carpeting was damaged or wet it might have impacted the subfloor
Look for signs of rot or mold
If you see any signs of serious damage or rot you need to have these panels replaced before installing new flooring
Vacuum up the rest of the debris
Once you're done making your repairs sweep or shop-vac up the remaining debris and glue-scrapings from the job before moving forward with installation
Once you've removed old carpet you can install new carpet laminate or other types of flooring
