Check the leaves and foliage for any spots or yellow coloring
Start by examining underneath the foliage the leaves and the stems of any brown or yellow spots
Note if the leaves look healthy with green bright coloring
If the plants have yellow or brown leaves wilted leaves or spots on them they are likely not very healthy
Avoid plants with leaves that look overly shiny or polished as they may have been treated with chemicals or fertilizer
Go for plants with new flowers or leaf buds
Examine the selection at the grower and opt for plants that have buds or new young flowers
They are often healthier and better quality
They will also often bloom better and have more vibrant blooms
Look for any signs of pests or disease
You should also examine the plants for any signs of pest such as pests crawling all over the plants or leaves that have bite marks or holes in them
You do not want to bring a plant with pests or disease into your home as it may infect your other plants and kill them off
Make sure the plants look clean and well potted
They should look healthy in their pot when you buy them
Discuss the maintenance of the houseplant with the grower
If you are buying the houseplants from a grower at a nursery talk to them about maintaining the plants indoors
Ask them for advice on watering the plants giving the plants fertilizer and making sure the plants bloom well
You should also talk to them about warning signs of declining health in the plants so you can nurse the plants back to health if needed
For example you may ask the grower “How often should I water the plants?” “What would be the best spot in my home for these plants?” and “What are the signs of disease or decline in these plants?”
Opt for low maintenance plants
If you do not have a lot of time to care for the houseplant you may go for plants that will require only minimal care
Ask the grower about houseplants that will be easy to care for and require very little watering or attention
For example an anthurium or a peace lily may be a good option for a low maintenance blooming houseplant
You should also avoid houseplants that are poisonous when chewed or swallowed if you have children and pets at home
You can ask the grower for recommendations on this as well
