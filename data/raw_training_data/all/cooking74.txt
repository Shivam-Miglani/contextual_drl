If you are interested in creating a more exotic fruit salad punch than the one described above you can experiment with the following ingredients
Various flavoring extracts
Gummy candies The right flavoring extract can add a lot of extra zip to your fruit salad punch
For instance a little dash of watermelon flavoring can make your fruit salad punch taste a little more delicious
Or if you prefer something really unusual some mangosteen flavoring extract can help give your fruit salad punch a wonderful tropical flavor
Vanilla sugar is a wonderful food to use in a lot of baking and punch making projects
Vanilla sugar is sugar that has been suffused with vanilla flavoring
Carefully mixing about 1 8 cup of vanilla sugar into your fruit salad punch will help give it a lovely vanilla flavor
This vanilla flavor will be strong enough to be noticed but not so strong that it overpowers the fruit flavors in your fruit salad punch
Gummy candies are another thing that's great to experiment with
You can choose gummy candies that fit with the theme of the event you are hosting or bringing your fruit punch to
All you have to do is add a couple handfuls of the gummy candies you want to use to your fruit salad punch
