Consider adding a bed skirt if you have a box-spring
Place a bed skirt over the box-spring and secure it around the top edges with upholstery twist pins
This will help keep the bed skirt in place
When you are finished put your regular mattress back on top right over the box-spring and bed skirt
Choose a color that compliments the rest of your room or your bedding
The bed skirt can be simple and plain pleated or ruffled
It's up to you
Cover your mattress with a mattress protector and a fitted sheet
The mattress protector will keep your mattress clean while the fitted sheet will give it a new look
You can use a solid-colored fitted sheet or a patterned one
Consider matching it to your bed skirt this way the two will blend together and appear as one piece
Place a flat sheet down onto your bed
Make sure that the top finished edge is facing down against the mattress
You will be folding it over a blanket later
Drape a blanket over the top of the fitted sheet
If you live in a cooler climate consider using a down comforter
Be sure to cover your comforter with a duvet cover to keep it clean
Duvet covers come in many different colors and patterns
Try using something that contrasts your fitted sheet
Fold the top edge of the fitted sheet over the blanket
This will create a nice band of color at the top of your blanket
Consider adding some decorative pillows against the headboard
You will need to take these off when you go to sleep but they can give your bed that final luxurious touch
They should be lined up next to each other and leaning against the headboard
These can be large rectangular pillows or large square pillows
Consider using something made from a fancy fabric such as velvet or brocade
Place your regular pillows down in front of the decorative pillows
Be sure to place your pillows inside some decorative covers
If you can a more unified look try to match the color or pattern of the decorative covers to your fitted sheet and flat sheet most are sold as a set
Consider placing a small decorative pillow in front of your regular pillows
Don't put too many or your bed will start to look cluttered
You will only need one or two
Try experimenting with different shapes such as round square or tube
Place a decorative throw or blanket at the foot of the bed
Fold the throw or blanket in half so that it does not cover your entire bed
