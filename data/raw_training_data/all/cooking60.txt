First make the Cajun seasoning by simply combining the ingredients
You won't be using all of this mixture so store the unused Cajun seasoning in a tightly closed jar and place in the refrigerator
Combine the ingredients for marinade
Mix thoroughly using a spoon
Set aside
Place the chicken in the plastic bag
Make sure that there is some space for the marinade in the bag even after the chicken is inside
Pour the marinade into the bag
Seal the bag well to avoid leaking
Shake bag to coat the chicken pieces thoroughly with the marinade
Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 20 minutes
At this point you may already light up the charcoal and heat the grill thoroughly
Place chicken pieces over the hot grill
Cook each side for at least 14 minutes before turning
Caution: A very hot grill may burn the outside part of the meat while leaving the inside part still undercooked
Check the chicken is done by making slits on the meat and making sure it is not pink
Cajun chicken is best served with fresh garden vegetables of your choice and jambalaya rice
You can also eat it with any pasta of your choice
