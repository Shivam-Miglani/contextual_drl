Find the soiled spot as quickly as possible
It can become extremely tricky to remove urine if your pet's urine soaks deep into the upholstery and even into the wood frame
In most cases you can spot the urine spot right away
If not you can try Using your nose
Pet urine has a very distinct smell and often smells like ammonia
Using a blacklight
Because of its chemical properties pet urine shows up under a blacklight specifically its scent-creating chemicals even when the stain has been dried or are days old
Outline these area in chalk or mark then with a sticky note to help you clean then when you turn on the lights
Soak up the urine with newspaper or paper towel
Soak up as much urine as you can by pressing newspaper or paper towels against the upholstery with gloved hands
Press down hard and deep
You can place the soaked up newspaper or paper towel where you'd like your pet to urinate
This is a positive way to help let them know where to urinate as you'll be transferring their urine smell to the appropriate location
Soak the soiled area with enzymatic cleaner
Leave it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes and then blot up as much cleaner as you can with newspapers a towel or paper towels
Finally leave it to dry
You may need to repeat this step again if the enzymatic cleaner doesn't get rid of the odor or stain the first time
Urine is composed of things that require enzymes to break down its chemical bonds
For example when a pet pees urea in their urine breaks down into a bacteria that produces the distinct scent of urine
As the urine is left longer to decompose the smells become worse
Fortunately most chemicals in urine are easily removed by water and other household detergents
However uric acid is the only component that is not water soluble and must be broken down by enzymes
Cover the area while the cleaner takes effect and while it dries
Some pet owners will cover the area loosely with aluminum foil or lay their laundry basket upside down over the stain to prevent their pets from urinating in the area again
It also helps to remind family members not to step or sit on the stain while it dries
It can take a long time even days for the stain to completely dry especially if the stain is particularly deep and more enzymatic cleaner was needed
Aluminum foil is a great deterrent tool to use to discourage your pet from urinating in the upholstery again
The crinkly sound and feel of foil when your pet steps on it is not pleasing to your pet or might even scare them off of the upholstery completely
For pillows or cushions you can leave them out in the sun to dry as long as you can
