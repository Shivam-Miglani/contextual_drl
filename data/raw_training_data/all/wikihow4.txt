Paint your canisters with latex paint
Pick and purchase a paint color of your choice
You may want to pick a color that matches your kitchen or whatever room you’re going to use the canister in
Then use a regular paint brush and apply a coat to the canister
Afterward add another coat of paint
By adding another coat of paint you’ll better seal the canister and make the paint job look seamless
If you want to save yourself some time consider spray painting your canisters for more of an industrial look
Consider picking a color that matches or blends with the color theme of whatever room you’ll put the canister
Use chalk paint to add a distressed look
A distressed look will complement a shabby chic look you might be trying to create in a given room
To do this use a regular paint brush to add a light coat of chalk paint
Then take a damp paper towel and wipe the canister down
When doing this some of the chalk will come off allowing the bottom color to bleed through
Some colors that are popular include white light green or pastel colors
Feel free to experiment with different chalk paints
There's no reason why this shouldn't be fun!
Stencil your canisters
Purchase or make your own stencils
Then fix the stencil to the canister with tape
Use chalk or paint to fill in the stencil
If you want let the stenciled area dry and paint or chalk paint it again
Ultimately using stencils is one of the best ways to personalize your canister
If you’re spelling out words consider using different colors for different letters
You can make your own stencil by taking thick paper or cardboard and cutting out whatever shape letter or design you want
Attach fabric or paper to your canisters
Depending on your taste you can personalize your canisters with fabric or paper
To do this either cover the entire canister in fabric or paper or just cover specific parts of it
Feel free to experiment with and use any type of fabric or paper you want
Consider wrapping a fabric ribbon or bow around the middle part of the canister
Cut and attach paper borders to the top edge of the canister
Place labels on the canister
In addition to decorating your canister you can put labels on them
Do this by either stenciling words onto the canisters or by attaching fabric or paper tags
Your labels can be purely decorative or they can reflect the new lives your refurbished canisters will have
For example you can label the cans “sugar” “oatmeal” or whatever you’ll store in them
Put glitter on your canisters before your paint completely dries
Sprinkle or spray glitter about an hour after you've painted
By applying glitter to your paint before it dries your glitter will stick to the canister
This will add a very personal touch and may complement other work you’ve done on the canister
