Adorn the staircase with framed family photos
For this idea you can use a variety of sizes
If you have a wide variety of small and large photos hang the smaller ones at eye level and the larger ones higher up
This way the viewer will be able to see each image equally well
Feel free to mix up eras as well
Place antique black-and-white or sepia photos with color photos from no more than 20 years ago
Display an antique city map
A black-and-white aerial view of streets and parks will give your home a more vintage feel
Hang an engraving or lithograph in a black frame or opt for an unframed canvas
Display it in your foyer to greet guests or in your dining room as a conversation piece
Hang monochromatic engravings
Black-and-white depictions of everyday life are versatile
You can hang them in multiple rooms
If you desire a change of d√©cor you can switch them out to different rooms
For example that country scene hanging in the bedroom might look equally nice in the living room
Display oil or acrylic reproductions
Don't fret if you can't afford that Impressionist masterpiece in the latest auction catalogue
There are plenty of websites and catalogues that sell framed oil and acrylic reproductions on canvas for reasonable prices
Hang them in the foyer the living room the bedroom or along the staircase
Decorate with vintage posters
The subject matter of posters is often more modern than other forms of vintage art
Examples include old movies propaganda form each World War and psychedelic imagery from the 1960s and 70s
Hang them in the living room bedroom or dinging room
If you have a room designated for entertainment classic movie posters would add a great touch
Place an antique vase on a fireplace mantle
Spice up a white or beige mantle with a brightly colored vase
If your mantle has a bolder paint job use a white vase for some contrast
Place a bouquet of real or artificial flowers in the vase or leave it empty
Set in the center to offset a rectangular work of wall art
Display a sundial outside
Place it in the front yard to greet guests or add an accent to the back garden
Go for a simple circular dial on a rectangular pedestal or a more ornate armillary sphere
Choose from stone metal or a combination of the two
No matter which shapes or materials you choose your sundial will definitely draw everyone's attention
