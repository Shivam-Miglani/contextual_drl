How to bake white bread
Combine one cup of milk and two tablespoons of butter in a small sauce pan over medium heat
As soon as the butter is melted turn off the heat
Allow the mixture to cool
Put 1/2 cup warm water into the small bowl
Then slowly add the yeast
Keep stirring while you do this to keep the yeast from clumping
Once the yeast and water are thoroughly mixed together leave the bowl for about five minutes
In the meantime get a large bowl and mix one cup of warm water with the salt and sugar
Return to your small saucepan of milk and butter from step 1
If the contents are no longer hot but just warm to the touch you can now pour the milk and butter mixture into the large bowl with the water and yeast
Mix everything thoroughly
You can now start adding in the unbleached bread flour a cup at a time
You will see that by the time you add the fifth cup the dough will be so stiff it will be hard to keep mixing it using a wooden spoon
At this point place the dough on a floured board and start kneading
Continue kneading the dough while adding the remaining flour little by little
Do this until the dough is no longer sticky
Get another large bowl and grease it with butter
Transfer the dough into this bowl then turn the dough over such that its top is also greased with butter
Now get a clean kitchen towel to cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise at room temperature
Wait until the dough has risen to about twice its original size
This may take approximately one hour
When the bread dough has already doubled in size punch down the dough to release trapped air
Remove from the bowl and set it onto a floured board
Then knead for about five minutes to remove the bubbles
Divide the dough in two
Roll each half into a rectangle then roll it each rectangle up like a jellyroll
Pinch the seam closed and tuck the edges under the loaf
Preheat your oven to 375F
Get two loaf pans and grease them with butter
Some people also like to spread a thin layer of yellow cornmeal on the pans
You may certainly try this if you wish
Put the loaves into the pans and cover again with a kitchen towel
Now wait for approximately thirty minutes to let the dough rise until it doubles in size
Put the bread into the oven and bake until it's golden brown
This often takes around 45 minutes
When you're done baking transfer the loaves onto a cooling rack
Wait until your bread has cooled before you cut
