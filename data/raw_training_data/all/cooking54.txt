Lay a piece of nori on the rolling mat shiny side down
Place about 1/2 cup of sushi rice on the nori
Wet your hands with water so the rice won't stick to your hands
Spread the rice over the nori with your hands leaving a half inch strip of nori uncovered at the bottom
Place your desired fillings along this strip of uncovered nori on the edge closest to you
Using the rolling mat begin to tightly roll the sushi
Start at the side nearest to you and roll away from you
Make sure you don't roll the rolling mat into your sushi
I can't imagine that would taste very good
When the sushi is completely rolled use the rolling mat to squeeze the sushi so it does not unroll when you are trying to cut it
Cut sushi and enjoy
