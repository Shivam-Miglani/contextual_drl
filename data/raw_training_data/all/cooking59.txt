Boil a pot-full of water
Add 1 teaspoon of salt
In a bowl combine milk eggs salt and nutmeg
Whisk it until it is smooth
Add the flour in three batches
Keep mixing it until you arrive on a doughy consistency
Let it dough rest for 10 minutes in a bowl covered with plastic film
Divide the dough into two portions
Take your grater and position it on top of the boiling water
Grate the first portion of your dough and let the pieces fall directly into the boiling water
Do this quickly to get evenly cooked spaetzles
Don't forget to stir to prevent the pieces from sticking to other pieces
When the spaetzle is cooked it will float to the surface
Then it's time to drain them or fish them out with a slotted spoon
Do the same for your second batch of dough
Let the spaetzle cool while spread on a large baking dish
In a large pan melt the butter and then add the sage all in medium heat
When the butter has turned brown add the onion and season with salt and pepper
Toss spaetzle in the butter sauce until each piece is coated
