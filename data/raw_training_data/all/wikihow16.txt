Create a focal point on the long wall
If you have a room that has long walls paired with shorter walls creating a narrow space it's best to create your focal point for the room on the long wall
If you try to place it on the narrower wall the room will look even bigger than it already does
A focal point can be an entertainment center or it can be a large piece like a painting
Basically it's what the attention is focused on in your space
Break up the wall into several areas
This tactic works particularly well if the wall is oddly shaped or if it has objects dividing it
Designate 2 or 3 "areas" on the wall and treat each one like its own wall
You can use groupings of pictures or different textiles to create different sections
It helps if the areas you create coordinate with other things in the room or hallway such as creating one area for the dining room and one for the living room on a common wall
Add horizontal lines
A long hallway or room that's also narrow doesn't leave much room for decoration so sometimes your best bet is to add some paint
One tactic is to create horizontal lines along the walls either with well-divided stripes or something more free-form such as organic wave-like lines
These stripes go along the whole length of the wall and this method can create the illusion of more space
Paint your own design as a focal point
If you don't want to hang anything on your walls paint something instead
For instance you could paint a mural or even create a funky cross-stitch pattern on your wall based on a pattern you buy at a sewing store
You could also create a fun color-blocking pattern that you've marked off in a square or rectangle
For instance try a starburst in varying colors and then outline the whole thing in a white or black rectangle
Paint the hallway with chalkboard paint
Chalkboard paint is an easy way to create a surface you can decorate again and again
Chalkboard paint comes in a variety of colors at most home improvement stores
Once you paint the wall you can draw on it with chalk or chalk pens
Alternatively let your kids go to town on the wall
You could add inspirational quotes or create a fun changing landscape
Add wallpaper for a simple colorful option
A simple way to decorate a long wall is to pick an interesting wallpaper
Choose a fun floral or a funky plaid
You can also choose a textured wallpaper or even something with gold leaf
You could even choose a wallpaper with a Victorian-type pattern
You'll find a wide variety of wallpapers at home improvement and design stores
There's something for everyone so don't be afraid to look
