Locate the leaks
If it didn't squirt you in the face you may have to go on a hole hunt
Does your hose leak at the faucet
Does it leak where you've joined two hoses
Does it leak at the point where you've attached a sprinkler head or spraying device
Or does it leak somewhere in the middle
Fix leaky joints
Detach the hose from other hoses or devices and thoroughly lube the threads of each with petroleum jelly
Reattach and you will notice fewer leaks or even none at all
Be careful trying to reattach the items as your hands will be slick
Another option is to use a rubber washer
These are available at a hardware or garden supply store and can be slipped onto the "female" end of the hose
This should prevent leaking when it is joined to another hose or device
Use rubber cement for tears or punctures
Using a dry paper towel dry off the section of hose where there is a hole or cut
If the hole is within a foot (30 cm) of the end of the hose try using a piece of dowel with paper towel wrapped around it to clean the inside of the hose
Apply some rubber cement to — and around — the hole
Fill in the hole but not so much that it gets inside of the hose
This could result in clogging up the hose and increasing the water's pressure causing more leaks and an incentive for the hose to burst at that weak spot
Use a tire puncture repair kit
These are most commonly sold at bicycle repair shops body shops car-part stores etc
Carefully read the directions of use and apply the repair substance to the hole
After drying buy a small sheet of solid rubber from a craft store hardware store or other supplier
You can also cut a small square out of an old rubber rain boot bicycle tire or any other rubber item you no longer use
Glue it over the leak and let dry (use a glue able to keep the rubber attached strongly
Get a coupling for more severe tears
They are available at a hardware store
Repair couplings work by allowing you to cut out the leaky portion of hose and re-join it where you made the cuts
Shutoff the water to the hose and cut out the bad portion
Splice in the repair coupling
It will have detailed instructions on the label
Now go dry yourself off
