MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer
It's best when served with scrambled eggs
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use
