Decide whether you want to use paper or fabric decoupage pieces
You will need to decide on your theme (some theme ideas are suggested next) first as this may affect whether or not you can find the designs on fabric or paper
Theme ideas include Victoriana the beach tropical cats or dogs stars and moons clothes animals cupcakes or doughnuts woodland critters flowers and leaves a safari makeup items butterflies photos of family pets or friends etc
Do a search on Instagram Pinterest or other sites with themes of photos and pictures to give you some ideas
Find or purchase the relevant decoupage paper or fabric
Cut out lots of pieces from the paper or fabric and place into piles
The piles should reflect size type of pictureshape and perhaps colors depending on what makes it easiest for you to use them when creating the decoupage design
Suitable paper or fabric would include decoupage paper made specifically for this purpose magazine pictures photos scrapbooking paper labels off groceries or clothing printed fabric craft fabric quilting fabric (fat quarters might be useful) CD or DVD paper covers stickers etc
Create a design plan
Once you have made the decision on the theme and obtained the paper or fabric pieces plan how the paper or fabric pieces will be affixed to the chair
To do this place the pieces on the chair seat and arrange until you like how it looks
When you're happy with the design take a digital photograph of it and print it out or do a quick sketch of where each piece is to be placed
Use this photo or sketch to guide placement of the pieces when adding them
The decoupage can overlap or be separated to allow the viewer to detect each individual piece (the paint color will show through nicely if you leave gaps)
Cut out more design pieces if needed
This isn't the time to be skimping on pieces
You don't need to confine your efforts to the seat if the design looks good going up the chair back and down the chair legs that's fine but just check the design looks good
Use poster tack to keep the pieces in place and stand back to check how it looks as a whole
