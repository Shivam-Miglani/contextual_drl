Choose a cleaning agent to treat the mold
You can use a mold-killing detergent diluted bleach or a commercial cleaner made specifically for killing mold
For a diluted bleach solution mix three parts water with one part bleach in a bucket
Don’t forget to test a small discreet area first
Bleach and other chemicals can discolor concrete that’s been colored or stained
Remove affected items
Any organic material adjacent to the moldy area can be infected
Throw away any disposables like cardboard boxes
Set aside other removable items like furniture or area rugs
Apply the solution
Use a heavy duty sponge or scrub brush to apply your chosen cleaning solution to all visible moldy areas on the concrete
Scrub the areas vigorously
If you’re using mold-killing detergent apply it directly to the spots and scrub it with a bristle brush
Don’t use a wire brush which can scratch concrete
Wear old clothes rubber gloves safety goggles and a respirator or dust mask
Let the solution soak
If the spots aren’t lifting leave the solution to sit for several minutes
Then scrub the areas with the solution until the mold is gone
Rinse outdoor concrete
Use a hot water pressure washer for the fastest and most effective rinse
Wear safety goggles sturdy footwear and long pants
Use a pressure rating of at least 3000 psi with a flow rate of at least four gpm (gallons per minute)
You can rent a pressure washer at a home or building supply store
You may need a van pickup truck or SUV to transport it and a friend to help load and unload it
Ask the rental agent how to use the washer and to give you any safety precautions
Find out if the washer comes with nozzles
Don’t use settings finer than fifteen degrees
Never use a zero degree nozzle on a pressure washer
Dry interior concrete with a towel
Once it’s dry inspect carefully for any mold that may not have been cleaned
If there is still visible mold rinse the area clean and try one of the stronger methods you haven’t used yet diluted bleach or commercial cleaner
Clean items you’ve set aside before placing them back in the area
Leather wood or inorganic furniture can be deep cleaned
Upholstered furniture with visible mold will need to be disposed of or reupholstered by a professional
Carpet that shows significant mold growth or is soaked completely through will need to be removed
