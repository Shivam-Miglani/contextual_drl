I can't imagine Christmas Eve without this zippy Italian seafood cioppino on the table
Loaded with shrimp crab clams and haddock this hearty stew is a seafood lovers dream come true
This stew is made in the slow cooker making it a great option for special occasions or busy weeknights
Serve with crusty bread or oyster crackers
In a 4-quart slow cooker combine the tomatoes onions celery clam juice tomato paste white wine garlic vinegar olive oil Italian seasoning bay leaves and salt
Cook covered on low heat for 6 hours
Stir in the haddock shrimp clams and crab meat
Continue cooking for 45 minutes or until the shrimp are pink and the haddock flakes easily when poked with a fork
Remove bay leaves and stir in parsley
Ladle the seafood cioppino into bowls and serve warm
