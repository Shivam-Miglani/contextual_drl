Embellish ordinary lampshades
Take a dusty old lampshade from dull to delightful with a simple macrame cover
These covers can easily be knotted to fit shades of different shapes and sizes meaning any light in your home can benefit from a custom fit
Make your own DIY lampshades by knotting the cord around a wire frame that’s been shaped to fit over a lamp or ceiling light
Incorporate shells beads or tassels to add complexity to your lampshades
Weave clever furniture covers
If you’re unhappy with the look of your loveseat or recliner but aren’t in a position to buy a new one some macrame accents may be just what you need to make you fall in love with your seating situation again
Drape an enchanting pattern over the back of the piece to give it a whole new decorative appeal
You could even resurface a worn out seat or foot stool with a new handmade finish
Make your own pillows and blankets
Top your sofa or favorite easy chair with an assortment of throw pillows you designed yourself
Keep a cozy throw blanket or two handy for when you have company
Choose a softer fabric for your furniture accessories to ensure optimum comfort
You can use ordinary macrame cord for these projects or draw on recycled materials like old t-shirts
Create themed sets of blankets and pillows using different knotting patterns and color combinations
Lay out a macrame table runner
For long or spacious dining tables that look awfully empty use a knit runner to break up negative space
You can then use the runner as a place to arrange flowers candles or a centerpiece while leaving the place settings free for serving home cooked meals
Leave a long fringe on both ends of the table runner for an elegant drape
Bring out your macrame table runner for springtime events or whenever you need to inject a little brightness and ornamentation into your dining area
Outline a mirror or portrait
Hide an uninspired frame with a tight macrame wrap
Textile frames provide a pleasant contrast to the focal point of the frame and they go perfectly in homes decked out with rustic or vintage decor
Be sure to remove the glass and backing from the frame before trying to tie the cord into place
