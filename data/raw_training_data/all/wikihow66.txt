Determine if the color will fade or run
Spot test the silk fabric by blotting a water-moistened cotton ball on a hidden point in the garment such as an inside seam
If the color does not fade or come off onto the cotton ball the garment is safe to hand wash
Whenever using any cleaning product such as vinegar or alcohol first test it out on a hidden portion of whatever item you’re washing
If any discoloration occurs bring the item to a local dry cleaner to have it professionally cleaned
For spot-treating stains the faster you get to the stain the better
Immediately flush the affected area with cold water rubbing the silk against itself to work the stain out without wearing the fabric
If water doesn’t work proceed to use a natural cleaning product
Never use chlorine bleach on silk
Use lukewarm water lemon juice or a mild vinegar solution to spot clean
Mix a couple tablespoons of either vinegar or lemon juice with two cups of lukewarm water to create a mild solution
Test it on an inconspicuous area
If there’s no discoloration dip the stained area of fabric into your solution use a clean spray bottle to apply it or gently pour the solution over the stain
Mild solutions made with lemon juice or vinegar are good for getting out stains from perspiration or deodorant
Never apply undiluted vinegar or any other cleaner to silk
Always make sure vinegar lemon juice ammonia or alcohol are diluted with lukewarm water
Use a mild ammonia or alcohol solution to remove tough stains
For tougher stains such as persistent food stains you’ll need to use a slightly stronger solution
You can try increasing your ratio of vinegar to water using equal parts of each
If a stronger vinegar solution doesn’t work mix equal parts ammonia or alcohol with lukewarm water
Diluted alcohol is great for getting out ink stains
Use ammonia to remove stains from chocolate wine or cosmetic products
