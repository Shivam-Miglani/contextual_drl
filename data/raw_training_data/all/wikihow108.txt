Remove the old finish if desired
You can apply varnish over an already-painted surface to preserve it or you can apply it to a raw unpainted surface
There are various ways to remove old finishes including using paint stripper and sanding
If your wooden furniture has never been painted or varnished or if you wish to preserve the original paint then you can proceed to Step 5
Consider removing old finishes with a paint stripper
Remove old paints and finishes by applying a paint stripping solution to the wood with a paintbrush
Leave the solution on the wood according to the manufacturer's directions then scrape it off using a putty knife with rounded corners
Do not allow the paint stripper to dry
Be sure to remove any paint stripper residue
How you remove the residue will depend on the type of paint stripper you buy but most strippers will need to be removed with turpentine or water
Consider removing old finishes with sanding
You can remove old finishes using sandpaper a sanding block or a handheld sander
Sandpaper and sanding blocks work best on uneven or curved surfaces such as knobs and chair legs
Handheld sanders work best on flat surfaces such as table tops
Start with a medium-grit sandpaper such as 150-grit and move up to a finer grit such as 180
Consider removing old finishes with a paint thinner
Much like paint stripper paint thinner can be used to remove old finishes
Soak an old cloth or rag with some paint thinner and rub it over the surface of your wooden piece
Once the old finish has been loosened scrape it off using a putty knife
Sand the wood with fine-grit sandpaper
Sanding the wood not only gets rid of any residual gloss or finishes but it also gives the varnish a rough surface to grip onto
Use 180 to 220-grit sandpaper and sand with the direction of the grain
Clean the wood and your work space with a damp cloth and let it dry
Your work space will need to be free of any dust or dirt before you can start applying the varnish
Clean your wood piece by wiping it down with a damp cloth
Be sure to sweep and vacuum the tables and floors of your work space as well you may have to use a damp cloth or mop
Consider filling the wood grain
Some open-grained woods such as oak need to have the grain filled in with a grain filler for a smooth finish
You can use a color that matches the wood's natural color or you can use the color of the stain you will be using
You can use a contrasting color to make the grain appear more pronounced or you can use a similar color to make the grain appear more subdued
