Install fencing
Line either side or both sides of your driveway with a low fence that matches the aesthetic of your home’s exterior
For more flexibility in your property’s appearance select materials that can painted like wood or vinyl
Enhance your landscaping even further by painting the fence a new color
Fencing also allows you to add more elements like hanging lanterns or flower baskets after installation
Being able to repaint your fence can help you update your borders' accents to complement your home if you repaint the exterior a new color
Line your driveway with ornamental trees
If you don’t like the idea of limiting access to the driveway from the lawn but still want to make a bold statement with vibrant colors go with this option
Plant the same species of ornamental tree along your driveway or create a pattern by alternating between species
Cornus Mas Eastern Redbud Japanese Tree or Dwarf Korean Lilac Kousa Dogwood Serviceberry
Plant shrubs
If ornamental trees would be too tall or crowded to suit your driveway but you’d still like both a substantial and natural border for it opt for shrubs instead
Also choose these if you’d like to tie the driveway into your home that much more by extending the shrub border around your home as well
Add even more pizazz by using the shrubs as topiary and trimming them into eye-catching designs
As with trees region and climate will determine what type of shrub is best for your area
Popular choices though include burkwood viburnum India hawthorn and “Pallida” Chinese witch hazel
Lay a flower bed
If you’d prefer your border to use color rather than height to draw attention to your driveway line it with flowers instead of shrubs trees or fences
Define the edges of your driveway with plants that catch the eye
Use this technique to divide your driveway from the rest of your lawn without seriously hindering accessibility from one to the other
However remember that this a high-traffic area so keep in mind that Vegetables can be just as colorful as flowers but since whatever you plant here will be exposed to lots of car exhaust don’t plant anything you intend to eat
Opting for durable ground cover plants (like blue star creeper or Corsican mint) is a better idea than planting fragile flowers since it’s always possible for a car to go off track and roll over your flower bed
Add something distinctive to curves
If you have a curved driveway keep in mind that the eye is naturally drawn toward to the curve(s) when viewing the driveway as a whole
Utilize this tendency by placing a unique design element there to punch up your property’s appearance that much more
Options include Planting a tree or shrub
Starting a water or rock garden
Adding a wishing well or other lawn decorations
