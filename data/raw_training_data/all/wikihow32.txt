Choose a time when your roommates and or family members are also out of the house
Let your roommates or family members know when you are leaving bleach in your toilet
Measure and pour bleach into your toilet or bidet
Locate a measuring cup and a bottle of bleach
Using the measuring cup pour 0.25 cup of bleach
After opening the lid and lift the seat of your stained toilet or bidet carefully pour the bleach into the bowl
Bleach is a corrosive substance
It can damage your eyes skin and lungs
It is also harmful if swallowed
When cleaning with bleach work in a well ventilated area and immediately wash any parts of your body that come in contact with the bleach
Let the bleach sit overnight or throughout the day
Once the bleach is in the bowl close the seat and shut the door to your bathroom to prevent children and pets from coming into contact with the bleach
After a coming home from a busy day or waking up from a great nightâ€™s sleep return to the bathroom and flush the toilet
Lift up the lid to reveal a clean stain-free toilet or bidet
If the toilet or bidet still has stains try this method again
