First make the confectioners frosting
Beat 1/2 cup butter until it becomes smooth
Add the vanilla extract
Put the mixer on low speed
Add the powdered sugar little by little
Add the milk
Switch to high speed
Beat the mixture until your frosting become fluffy and light
If you want colored frosting you can add food coloring drop by drop at this point while you continue blending
Set your frosting aside
Now sift together the flour baking soda salt ginger cloves nutmeg and cinnamon in a large bowl
Using the electric mixer beat together the sugar and 1 2 cup butter until the mixture becomes light and fluffy
Add the molasses and egg and beat the mixture again until everything is well combined
Add the flour mixture into the liquid mixture then beat again until everything is thoroughly mixed
Divide the dough into two equal parts
Wrap each separately in plastic
Refrigerate the dough for two hours or even overnight until it becomes firm
Preheat the oven to 177 C 350 F. Place rack at the center of the oven
Roll out the dough to about inch thickness on a lightly floured surface
Then cut out the cookies using a gingerbread cutter
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper
Put your cookies onto the backing sheet atop the parchment paper
Make sure you leave at least 1 cm space per cookie
Bake the cookies until they are firm and the edges begin turning brown
This normally takes about 8-12 minutes
Take the cookies out of the oven and leave them on the baking sheets for about a minute to let them cool
Then you can transfer them to the wire rack to let them cool completely
Place the frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip
Decorate the gingerbread man as desired
