Wash smaller garments in the washing machine
It’s best to avoid washing larger garments like sweaters or leggings in a washing machine
However smaller Merino products like hats socks or mittens will be able to hold their shape better
Wash with like colors and fabrics
Prevent any potential damage from your Merino wool bleeding by washing it with similarly colored garments such as darks brights or lights
It’s also a good idea to wash it with clothing of similar weights or harder fabrics like canvas or denim for the sake of minimizing the pilling of the wool fibers
To be completely safe consider washing your Merino wool by itself
Keeping it separate from other laundry will preserve it and your other garments for longer
Turn garments inside-out
To help keep your Merino wool from pilling or getting fuzzy on the outside wash it inside-out
Use a wool-specific washing liquid
Merino wool necessitates a very gentle soap that will minimize bleeding or fiber-damage
Wash it with a shampoo or soap that’s especially formulated for wool or with a mild detergent that is free from bleach and fabric softeners
Pick the right cycle
You want to select a gentle delicate or knit cycle so that the rotation of the machine will not damage the wool fibers or shape of your garment
Note if you cannot control the speed andor temperature of your washing machine stick to washing your Merino wool by hand
Set the right temperature
You want to wash your Merino wool at a consistent warm low or cold temperature
Warm (about 30 degrees C or 85 degrees F) is the usually the best bet but be sure to check the care instructions of your garment’s tag to ensure you have the right temperature guidelines for your particular product
Never change temperatures for your rinse cycle
To avoid shrinkage and felting you need to keep the temperature of your entire wash cycle constant
Either do all warm water or all cold water never a mix of the two
Never use hot water since high temperatures can seriously shrink your wool
Remove from the machine immediately
As soon as the washing cycle is complete take your Merino wool out of the machine and dry it according to the care instructions
Leaving it wet in a pile of other laundry will stretch and misshape the fibers
