Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight
This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam
There are several different types of floral foam
Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers
You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop
Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this
You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh
Be careful when handling this type of foam
It is very soft when dry and easily dented
Put the foam block into a vessel
You can use a fancy bowl planter vase or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles
It should sit below the rim of your bowl planter or vase
If the foam is too big cut it down to the right size and shape
If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape
Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water
You can use roses in all one color or you can experiment using different colors
You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect
If you plan on using multiple shades or colors put them into separate buckets
This will make sorting through them easier
Consider using fragrant roses
This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch
Cut about 3 inches (762 centimeters) off of each stem
Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle
It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well
If your foam block is very small you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (763 centimeters)
Poke the roses into the foam
Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch
Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible
You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam
If you are sticking the roses into a bowl planter or vase consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect
If you are going for an ombre effect start with your lightest color then move on to the darkest
You can arrange it in stripes or rings
Add some finishing touches
At this point your centerpiece is done
You can move it to the table and leave it as is or you can add some more touches to it
Here are some ideas Arrange short votive candles around the centerpiece
Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece
Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel
