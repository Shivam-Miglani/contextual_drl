Gently whisk the cream in a medium sized bowl until a soft and smooth surface appears
Cover it and place in a refrigerator
This will be used later at the end of this recipe
In a large saucepan combine vanilla sugar and milk and bring gently to boil while stirring gently
This should be done to allow for a deep and well blended mixture
It goes without saying that you have to use medium temperature
Divide the chocolate squares between several heatproof capacity glasses
Of course the number of glasses to be used will depend with the amount of milk that you ll have prepared in the large saucepan As explained in step two For instance if you used 2 liters of milk as recommended in this recipe you should be able to yield about eight 300ml-capacity glasses
Pour the milk over the broken chocolate squares being careful not to overfill the glasses
If you fill the glasses to capacity you ll not have an allowance to add the remaining ingredients
So ensure that you leave a small allowance
Remove the cream Prepared in step one from the refrigerator and pour it gently on top of the milk in all the glasses
Serve while hot
