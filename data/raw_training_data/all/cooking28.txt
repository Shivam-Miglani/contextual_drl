How to make sweet and sour pork
Marinate the pork strips in a mixture of soy sauce and about 1 tsp
cornstarch for about 20 minutes
Prepare the batter: Mix egg flour and 1 tablespoon oil in a bowl
In case the batter becomes too thick add a small amount of warm water
The batter must not be runny but should slowly drip off from a spoon
Place the pork strips in the batter
Heat 3 cups of oil in the wok over high heat
To test if the oil is hot enough place a small drop of the batter mixture
The fried batter should sizzle and float on top if the oil is hot enough
When this happens turn the heat down to medium
Place the flour in a plastic bag
Remove a small batch of pork strips from the batter and place them in the bag
Seal bag and shake to coat the pieces evenly with the cornstarch
Remove the pieces of coated pork from the bag
Deep fry the pork pieces in the wok until they are golden brown and crisp
Drain the strips on paper towels in a colander then transfer the drained pork pieces to a large platter
Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the rest of the pork strips until all of the pork has been cooked
For crisper pork strips you can deep fry the strips a second time
Remove most of the oil from wok but leave about 2 tablespoons
Stir-fry the carrots bell peppers and onion in this oil
Add the catsup soy sauce vinegar sugar and pineapples and allow the mixture to boil
Then turn the heat down to low
Prepare the cornstarch slurry by mixing 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with a small amount of water to form a smooth watery paste
Add this slurry to the sauce and stir thoroughly while simmering until sauce is slightly thick
Pour this sauce mixture over the pork strips
