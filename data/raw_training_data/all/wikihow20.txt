Buy materials to use when cleaning with rubbing alcohol
After you get your rubbing alcohol you’ll need to secure materials to use to help you clean
Ultimately you’ll be able to use a variety of cotton or other fabric products to aid in your cleaning
For surfaces that may scratch easily consider microfiber rags
Such surfaces include plastic (like keyboards or mice) other computer accessories or car components
For surfaces that are hard to access you’ll want to consider cotton Q-tips
Such surfaces include groves in plastic or metal auto parts
For surfaces in which you need a somewhat abrasive aid use regular cotton rags or clothes
Whenever possible use clean white rags to lessen the chance of color transfer
Confirm that the material you’ll be cleaning won’t be damaged by rubbing alcohol
Before you begin the process of cleaning with rubbing alcohol you need to make sure that the surface or material won’t be damaged by it
This is important since rubbing alcohol can damage certain surfaces

Be careful when using alcohol on delicate and aged fabrics or finished wood
Rubbing alcohol may remove lacquer or finish from wood
Clean the surface of the material
Before you clean the material with alcohol you need to prepare it by wiping it down with water first
Wiping it down and removing dirt and grime is important as any residual dirt could hinder the cleaning process andor damage the material
Take a clean rag
Depending on whether the surface is delicate or not you'll need to choose between a regular cotton rag or a microfiber rag
Dampen the rag
Wipe the material down gently and slowly
Allow the material to dry
Consider blowing or using a cool blow dryer to blow away dust or residual fibers left from a rag
