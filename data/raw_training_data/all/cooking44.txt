Cooking rice properly may seem like the most basic kitchen task yet somehow many people still seem to get it wrong
There are many different ways to cook rice properly and there are many different types of rice which all require different types of cooking
Investing in a rice cooker is a good idea too and it reduces cooking time and makes for an easy clean up
Place the rice in the strainer and rinse until the water is clear and not cloudy
Rinsing rice helps get rid of any excess starch and impurities
Place the rice in the pot along with the water and bring to a boil uncovered at medium heat
When the rice is boiling turn the heat down to medium low
Place the lid on the pot however do not cover the top completely so that the steam has somewhere to escape
It is optional at this point to add a small amount of butter or olive oil and the salt to the rice
Checks the rice to see if any holes have developed
If there are holes drop the heat down to low
Leave rice on low heat for another 15 minutes and then removes from heat and fluff with fork
