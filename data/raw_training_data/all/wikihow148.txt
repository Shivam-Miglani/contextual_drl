Choose the type of stain or dirt you are dealing with
Mold mildew or algae require different methods and chemicals than do rust stains or cement and mortar smears
Clean your brick with a solution of chlorine bleach if you have mildew or mold problems
Mix chlorine bleach with water in a large bucket using equal proportions
Pour the solution into a pump type garden sprayer and pump it up
Wet a section of wall (or patio if cleaning pavers) with a water hose
Spray the bleach solution on the surface beginning at the top on a wall soaking it thoroughly
Allow the bleach solution to react with the stains for a few minutes but do not leave it long enough for it to begin to dry
Rinse a small section of wall to see if the solution is having the desired effect
For serious stains scrub the wall with pure bleach using an acid brush on a broom-type handle
Rinse the wall thoroughly with water
Be careful not to let the bleach solution dry on the wall before rinsing
Use an acid solution to clean mortar stains rust from irrigation well water or soil that a bleach solution doesn't clean to your satisfaction
Buy an acid based masonry detergent or muriatic acid available at home improvement stores hardware stores or building supply centers
(Review the Warnings below before purchasing or using any muriatic acid solution) Fill a plastic bucket 23 full of clean water
Add acid at a proportion of about 1 part acid to 3 parts water but do not fill the bucket too full as you will not want this solution to splash out accidentally
Wet the wall or other surface with a garden hose
Brush the diluted acid solution on the wall scrubbing as you apply it with an acid brush
After applying and scrubbing with the acid solution allow the acid to work for 10 to 15 minutes being careful not to let the wall dry out
After giving the solution time to work rinse thoroughly with copious amounts of water
Rinse all surfaces exposed to either of the above mentioned cleaning solutions using plenty of water to dilute them to prevent damage to surfaces or plants
Consider sealing the brick to prevent future staining or soiling
Use a siloxane or silicone sealant applied following the manufacturer's directions
