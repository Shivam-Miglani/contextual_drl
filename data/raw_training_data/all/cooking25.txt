How to make the perfect scrambled eggs
Crack the eggs and place contents in the mixing bowl
Add milk and salt
Whisk the egg mixture for two minutes using an upward tilted circular direction to add fluffiness to the mixture
Keep doing this until the mixture becomes frothy and even colored
Alternatively you could place the egg mixture in a blender and mix for about 25 seconds
Heat your frying pan over medium heat
If you are using butter allow the butter to melt in the pan but avoid burning it by lifting the pan off the heat as soon as the butter starts to bubble
You could also add some oil to the butter as pure butter tends to burn more easily
Lower your heat
Add the egg mixture
Don't stir immediately but just allow the egg mixture to settle slightly into pan
Tilt the skillet in a circular direction to distribute the runny parts evenly
Make sure eggs don't start to brown
With a spatula break apart the large pieces as they form
Flip over the eggs and allow them to cook for about 15 to 25 seconds more
Lift the pan to avoid browning the eggs
Remember they must stay fluffy and yellow
As soon as no runny parts remain transfer your scrambled eggs to a serving platter
If desired you could sprinkle a little more salt and pepper before serving
