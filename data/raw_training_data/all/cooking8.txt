How to make grilled cheese
Soften your butter by putting it in the microwave for 5 seconds (reminder NEVER put tinfoil in the microwave)
Spread some butter on both sides of both slices of bread
Place 2 pieces of the American cheese on one slice of bread
Put your frying pan on medium heat
You don't need to put any butter or oil on the pan since you've already spread butter on the outside of your bread
You'll know the sandwich is ready when the bread turns golden brown
Use your spatula to peak every once in a while

When the under-side is golden brown flip the sandwich with a firm stroke
Repeat step 7
It should take less time this go around
When the underside is golden brown remove the bread from the pan with your spatula
Use a cutting board to cut your grilled cheese sandwich in half
