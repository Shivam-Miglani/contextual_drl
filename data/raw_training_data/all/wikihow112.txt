Use lemon juice instead of vinegar
Lemon juice has the same acidic properties as vinegar and can be equally as effective
Fresh lemon usually works better than bottled lemon juice
Try rolling the lemon on a hard surface with some pressure before cutting it open
This will make the lemon easier to juice
Squeeze the juice out of a lemon and place in a spray bottle with water or use a towel to apply the lemon juice to the glass
Alternatively you can use the lemon itself on the surface of the glass
Just cut the lemon in half and rub the open area on the glass with a fair amount of pressure
Allow the lemon to soak in then remove from the glass using water or a traditional glass cleaner
Try lemon or orange essential oil
Essential oils are becoming increasingly popular due to their rumored health and cleaning benefits
Citrus-based essential oils such as lemon and orange may remove hard water deposits
This has an added benefit as well the oil tends to serve as a water repellant and may prevent future spot buildups
Place several drops of the oil in water and use a sponge or a towel to apply the solution to the glass
Allow to soak then scrub lightly with the towel or sponge
Remove from the glass using water or a traditional glass cleaner
Apply white toothpaste to the area
As strange as this may sound toothpaste is made to remove build-up so it works fairly well on hard water spots
Water down the toothpaste with some water so that it spreads more easily and so that you can use less toothpaste
Apply the paste to the glass and allow to sit
Scrub lightly with a brush a towel or a sponge
Wash the paste away from the glass with water
Clean the glass with water or a traditional glass cleaner but be sure to dry it thoroughly so that the water spots do not re-form
Make a paste of baking soda and vinegar
The paste will bubble when you combine the two
You can wait for the bubbling to subside or you can apply the still-bubbling paste directly onto the glass
Do not combine vinegar and baking soda in a closed container as the resulting gas expansion may cause the lid to forcibly fly off
Apply the paste to the glass and allow to sit
Scrub lightly with a brush a towel or a sponge
Wash the paste away from the glass with water
Clean the glass with water or a traditional glass cleaner but be sure to dry it thoroughly so that the water spots do not re-form
