Use an old rag or cloth
To clean your zinc objects use an old rag or cloth
You do not want to use a new cloth or one you currently use because it could get ruined
If you donâ€™t have a used rag or cloth you can make one by cutting up on old t-shirt or piece of clothing
Choose a lemon or vinegar to clean your zinc
If you aren't worried about removing the patina from your zinc objects use lemon juice or vinegar to clean your objects
If you choose lemon juice you will need one or two lemons cut in half
If you choose to use vinegar use plain white vinegar
Choose toothpaste or a baking soda paste
If you want to keep the patina intact use solutions that are less acidic like toothpaste or baking soda
If you choose to use toothpaste any kind of toothpaste ie Arm & Hammer Colgate or Aquafresh will work
If you choose to make a baking soda paste depending on how large the object is use a teaspoon (for smaller objects like jewelry) to a tablespoon (for larger objects like tabletops or pots) of baking soda
Then gradually mix in water until a paste forms
Gradually mix in the water by alternating mixing with water
For example add a few drops of water mix and then gradually add more water until a paste forms
Use an old toothbrush
When cleaning small or hard to reach areas use a toothbrush that you can discard
This can be an old toothbrush that you do not use or one that you are willing to replace
After using the toothbrush instead of throwing it away store it with your cleaning supplies so you can reuse it again
