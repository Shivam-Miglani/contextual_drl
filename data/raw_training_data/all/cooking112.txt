Step away from the packet of onion soup -- you don't need it
I've got something even better for you
The sweetness of the caramelized onions along with the one-two punch of both onion powder and dried onions is perfectly balanced by the creamy sour cream and cream cheese
But I have to warn you you may want to eat the entire bowl yourself it is THAT good
Using a mixer or food processor until well combined
Refrigerate until ready to use
