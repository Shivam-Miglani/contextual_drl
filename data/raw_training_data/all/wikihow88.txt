Clean and store fresh basil
After you collect basil examine it and remove any dead or yellow leaves that you find
Rinse it thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris
Allow it to air dry or pat it dry with a paper towel
Then put it in an airtight container like a ziplock bag or plastic storage container
The basil can last for up to a few weeks
Just use the leaves or break pieces off as necessary
Blanch and freeze the leaves
Remove basil leaves from their stem and drop them in a pot of boiling water for five to ten seconds
Remove them with a slotted spoon and transfer them directly to a large bowl with water and ice in it
After several minutes remove the leaves and lay them out flat to dry on paper towels before storing them in the freezer
Place basil leaves in a freezer-safe container or ziplock bag
Basil leaves will keep in the freezer for several months
Dry your basil
Place basil stems in a dry paper bag and place the bag in a warm dry place such as an attic or kitchen cupboard
Let them dry for one or two weeks then remove the leaves from the stems
Keep the leaves as intact as possible and store them in canning jars
It is best to keep full leaves of dry basil and crumble them at the last minute if necessary
Pull off any yellow or spotted leaves before drying your bail
Dried basil should be kept for about a year or as long as it keeps the same distinct aroma
You can also dry basil by hanging it up in bunches in a warm dry room
Keep fresh basil in water
Clean stems of basil and trim off their bases
Place them in a glass jar with about 1 inch (25 cm) to 2 inches (51 cm) of water at the bottom
Basil stems will keep for up to two weeks if they are kept at room temperature and out of direct sunlight
Make “basil cubes” In a food processor add 1 cup (250 ml) of basil leaves and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of grape seed oil
Process this mixture until the basil leaves are in small bits then add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) water and process again to make a paste
Pack the mixture tightly into an ice cube tray and freeze it
Once the cubes are frozen transfer them into a freezer-safe container or ziplock bag to store them for easy use
You can add basil cubes to sauces soups and curries for easy seasoning
Basil cubes will keep in the freezer for approximately three to four months
