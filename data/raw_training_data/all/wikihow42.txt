Collect water from rain snow or other precipitation
Set out an open container to catch rain snow hail or dew
Choose a spot that is clear of tall trees that may obstruct the fall of precipitation
Large leaves can also be used to collect water and funnel it into another container
Get water from a stream river or lake
Look for clear-running water in a stream river or lake
Opt for a smaller body of water if possible since larger lakes or rivers will more than likely be polluted
Remember that water isn't necessarily safe to drink because it looks clean and should be disinfected
Filter the water to remove dirt or debris
Pass the water you've collected through some sort of filter to remove gunk and debris if necessary
Pour the water through a coffee filter t-shirt clean sock or other porous material
You should still disinfect the water to remove harmful bacteria
Boil water over a fire to disinfect it
Water can be boiled in an aluminum glass or ceramic container
Use two large sticks or other similar things to hold the container just above the fire
Let it heat for five minutes to completely disinfect the water
In a pinch you can attempt to boil water in a paper plastic or tree bark container
Make sure the container is entirely full and that the flames do not touch the vessel
Make a solar water still with a plastic sheet
Dig a hole in the ground that is slightly taller and wider than your container and place the container in the middle
Place leaves or other vegetation around the container and lay the plastic sheet over the hole
Weigh down the edges of the plastic with rocks and place a rock in the middle of the plastic just over the container so that the plastic is angled down
Condensation will form under the plastic and roll down into the container
The water formed will be distilled and should be safe to drink
To be safe you can boil it along with other water you collect
You may have to let condensation form for a day or two to collect a sizable amount of water
