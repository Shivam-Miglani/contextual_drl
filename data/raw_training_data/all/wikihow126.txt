Choose a box that holds 10 pounds (45 kg) or less
Too big of a box will cause your fragile items to shift around and possibly break
It is better to pack these items in a smaller box
If youâ€™re hiring movers ask them if they have specialty boxes for fragile items
These boxes might include cardboard separators for glasses or boxes shaped for frames
Line the bottom of the box with crumpled packing paper or packing peanuts
This will provide some cushioning for your precious belongings
You can buy these supplies at a post office office supply store or hardware store
Cover the bottom entirely in a single layer of padding
Wrap each item individually in bubble wrap or packing paper
Bubble wrap is better for thin delicate objects like plates china or lamps
Packing paper is better for slightly sturdier objects like picture frames or lamp shades
Wrap each item completely taping down the edges with masking tape
For glasses mugs and vases stuff a wad of crumbled paper inside
Do not use clothing or towels to stuff boxes with fragile items
These are not secure enough to prevent breakage
Pack each item in the box according to its shape and size
Be careful with stacking fragile items
Try to avoid putting items on top of each other
If you have to stack put heavier items on the bottom
Slide plates and picture frames in vertically
Do not lay them flat
Keep lamps and lamp shades in separate boxes
Place glasses and cups upside down in the box
Add more packing peanuts paper or bubble wrap to fill in empty spaces
Make sure there is a thin layer of padding between each object
Stuff extra padding into any empty spaces afterwards
Put an additional layer of packing peanuts or crumpled paper on top
Use as much as packing material as you need to fill in all of the empty spaces
You do not want fragile items shifting around in the box
Tape the box closed before it is too full
The box should be full but not bulging at the edges
Don't overstuff boxes with fragile items
When you are done packing each box close the top
Seal the top and the bottom along the openings and seams with packing tape
Write fragile on all 4 sides of the box
Use a broad dark marker to write this in large letters
Draw arrows onto the box to mark which side is up
Label it on all sides
When packing the truck make sure that heavier objects are not placed on top of this box
Don't forget to label what is inside of the box
For example you might write "FRAGILE plates" or "FRAGILE--lamp"
