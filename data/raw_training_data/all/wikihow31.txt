Read a book
You can read the book quietly to yourself or you can read it aloud to your friends and family
If you have small children have them work on an art project related to the story when you are done reading
For example If you just read The Very Hungry Caterpillar you can have the kids made a "next" page in the story by gluing pieces of colored paper onto printer paper
If you read The Rainbow Fish have the kids cut a fish out of purple or blue paper and then decorate it using glitter glue
If it's dark don't fret
Light a candle and get cozy with a blanket and your favorite book
Do some writing
Much like reading writing can help pass time
If it's dark light a candle or two
Get out a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil and try one of the following Write a letter to a relative
Write a list
The list can be on anything from shopping lists to foods that are blue
Play word-games like Hangman or Mad Libs
If you don't like to write draw a picture instead
Watch movies on a portable DVD player
If it is fully charged you should be able to watch at least 3 hours of movies
To save battery power try to keep the screen as dim as possible and close any apps that you are not using
Listen to or play some music
If you have a portable music player you can pass the time by listening to your favorite songs
If you know how to play an instrument you can practice a song that you have been learning or you can teach yourself a new one
If you are feeling restless try singing or dancing along to your favorite songs
Get crafty
This is a great way to pass time
Not only will you let your creativity soar but you'll also have something beautiful to show off by the time the powder gets back
Even if you are not a crafter you might want to consider this
You might find a new hobby for yourself or discover a hidden talent
Listed below are some simple craft ideas to get you started Do some drawing or coloring
If you own some paints and a canvas you can also try painting instead
