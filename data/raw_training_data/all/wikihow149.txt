Place down several courses on each end of the wall
These are the "leads" You can then attach a piece of builder's line at the top of each brick as you lay up the remaining brick in this wall keeping them aligned and level
As you work your wall will look like a shallow "U" moving up 2-3 courses on either side before filling in the middle with bricks
This ensures that you keep each course level
Stagger the bricks on each course by starting with a half or turned brick
If you are turning the corner you began at you will set each course half a brick back from the previous course so that each course is staggered half a brick
If you are turning the corner where you began put the first brick in the first course so that it is square and lay a few brick in this direction also
You don't want the joints of your wall to be even or the wall will be weak
You can either break a brick in half and start with a half brick or turn a brick sideways (if you're structure is two bricks thick) and start with that
Keep the height of the brick the same using a spirit or carpenter's level and keep the end joints (head joints) equal as you build up
The standard bed and head joints are 3⁄8 inch (10 cm) but this can be adjusted to your preference up to 3⁄4 inch (19 cm) or even more
Strike the head and bed joints with a "jointer" or "joint striker" when the mortar has begun to set
The jointer is a piece of tubing whose diameter is the same or slightly larger than your joint spacing bent in an "S" shape
Hold the tool on one end and rub it along the mortar joint between your brick with the curved portion of the tool to smooth out the mortar joint
Brush the face of the brick with a "foxtail" brush to wipe away excess mortar and finish smoothing the joint
It takes a lot of practice to be able to tell when the mortar is set properly to strike and brush the joints but basically when it is hard enough to touch with your finger and not leave an impression it is ready
Continue laying the brick until you are level with the leads you laid up then begin at the ends or corners laying either in another direction or straight up with another lead
Once you have this rhythm down you should be able to move quickly no matter what structure or shape you're making
The same basic pattern is used the entire time
Move the guidelines
Set the mortar
Stagger your first brick
Wipe away excess mortar
Build up the outsides or leads of the wall before filling in the middle
